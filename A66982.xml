         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>TO THE KING OF ENGLAND, And all Crowned Heads, and Soveraign Princes whatever.</head>
            <p>IT is the Advice of the <hi>Royal Prophet</hi> to <hi>you</hi> his <hi>Royal Brethren,</hi> P≈øal. 2. 10, 11, 12. <hi>Be Wi≈øe now therefore O ye Kings, be instructed ye Judges of the Earth: Serve the Lord with Fear, and rejoice with Trembling: Ki≈øs the Son le≈øt he be angry, and ye pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ri≈øh from the way when his Wrath is kindled but a little, Ble≈ø≈øed are all they that put their tru≈øt in him.</hi> And the rea≈øon of it was, beeau≈øe <hi>he that ≈øitteth in the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens,</hi> who is ≈øo much <hi>Superiour</hi> to the <hi>highe≈øt</hi> of them all, had ≈øet <hi>his King upon his holy Hill of Zion,</hi> ver. 6. and as the re≈øult of his Eternal <hi>Decree,</hi> had bid him <hi>ask of him, and he would give him the Heathen for his Inheritance, and the uttermo≈øt parts of the Earth for his Po≈ø≈øe≈ø≈øion,</hi> ver. 7, 8, and as the Effect of that his <hi>Roy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alty, he ≈øhould break them with a Rod of Iron, and da≈øh them in pieces like a Potters Ve≈ø≈øel.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now the time ≈øeems to draw on, when this is to befully accompli≈øh'd; and is it not the duty of the <hi>Watchman</hi> to
<pb facs="tcp:44425:3"/> give the warning before it is too late? For what will it advantage to be told of Danger, when it will not be in your Power to prevent it? To be minded of the Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach of <hi>Chri≈øt's Kingdom,</hi> when <hi>his Iron Rod</hi> ≈øhall be ≈øhaking over you, and <hi>your Power, your Intere≈øts, your Alliances, your Glory, your Wealth, and Kingdoms</hi> all da≈øh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>in pieces</hi> again≈øt one another? For if you chance to be of tho≈øe, who give <hi>your Power to the Bea≈øt,</hi> this will unavoidably be <hi>your Fate,</hi> both <hi>yours and Babylon's in one Hour to</hi> come to Confu≈øion, <hi>Rev.</hi> 18. 10.</p>
            <p>For the preventing whereof, this following Treati≈øe is here with all humility pre≈øented; and may it among tho≈øe many <hi>Voices and Trumpets</hi> which have of late ≈øounded to the World, have that good effect to <hi>awaken your mo≈øt Serene Maje≈øties,</hi> to what alone is <hi>your true intere≈øt of State,</hi> and that is, to <hi>hate the Whore,</hi> and <hi>make her de≈øo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late and naked,</hi> Rev. 17. 16. for otherwi≈øe there can be nothing better expected, than to <hi>partake of her Plagues,</hi> Rev. 18. 4.</p>
            <p>Would <hi>you (Soveraign Princes)</hi> as it befel <hi>Nebuchad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nezzar,</hi> your <hi>Golden Head,</hi> as he is called, <hi>Dan.</hi> 2. 38. be contented, it ≈øhould be <hi>be ≈øaid to you,</hi> the <hi>Kingdom is departed from you, and they ≈øhall drive you from among≈øt Men?</hi> Dan. 4. 31, 32.</p>

For it was not for nothing, that ≈øo much <hi>Scorn and Contempt</hi> was
<pb facs="tcp:44425:3"/> thrown upon tho≈øe <hi>mighty Monarchs; Monarchs,</hi> who were ≈øo <hi>indeed;</hi> for they wanted no <hi>Allies,</hi> or <hi>Confe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derates</hi> to ≈øupport them; for they were <hi>Kings of Kings,</hi> Dan. 2. 37. and all <hi>People, Nations, and Languages trembled and feared before them, whom they would they ≈ølew, and whom they would they kept alive; and whom they would they ≈øet up, and whom they would they put down,</hi> Dan. 5. 19. Believe it <hi>(great Sirs)</hi> it was not for nothing that ≈øuch <hi>memorable Examples</hi> were ≈øet forth, <hi>it was for your Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monition, upon whom the Ends of the World are come;</hi> as it is 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10, 11.

            <p>It hath in Effect done all this already, the <hi>Babyloni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an,</hi> the <hi>Per≈øian, the Greek Monarchies</hi> have already been utterly de≈øtroyed by it, and the <hi>Roman</hi> ≈øo far, as to ≈øtand upon its la≈øt Legs, (or rather to expre≈øs it in the words of <hi>the Vi≈øion, Dan.</hi> 2. 33.) <hi>to have both its Legs and Feet ≈øo broken,</hi> as to ≈øtand only on <hi>≈øome of its Toes;</hi> Some of tho≈øe <hi>ten Kings</hi> I mean, which after the <hi>taking of Rome, became the parts and ≈øupport of that Empire.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And as <hi>Daniel</hi> ≈øaid to <hi>Nebuchadnezzar, Thou art this Head of Gold,</hi> Dan. 2. 38.

            <p>
               <hi>Be Wife now therefore,</hi> let me again repeat it, <hi>O ye Kings; be in≈øtructed ye Judges of the Earth;</hi> let nothing draw you from what is your <hi>true Intere≈øt,</hi> let none of the <hi>Allurements,</hi> none of <hi>the Sorceries of the great Whore, of her,</hi> who hath <hi>glorified her ≈øelf, and lived deliciou≈øly, who hath ≈øaid in her Heart, I ≈øit a Queen, and am no Widdow,</hi> and <hi>≈øhall ≈øee no Sorrow,</hi> but who≈øe <hi>Plagues</hi> notwith≈øtanding <hi>≈øhall come in one Day;</hi> let no <hi>tenderne≈øs for her,</hi> with whom <hi>any of you have lived deliciou≈øly</hi> make you pity, <hi>bewail, and lament her,</hi> le≈øt <hi>your Judgment too come in one Hour with hers,</hi> Rev. 18. 7, 8, 9, 10. No; <hi>≈øtand as far off</hi> as you can, for fear <hi>of her Torment; ha≈øten away, ha≈øten away,</hi> that the <hi>Ruins of her Fall</hi> reach you not.</p>
            <p>You ≈øee how certainly all is foretold, you ≈øee how much of this is already begun; what is behind, for <hi>your Kingdoms,</hi> (and what ≈øhould be more dear to you than your mo≈øt glittering Crowns,) for you Souls ≈øake <hi>dread,</hi> and <hi>avoid.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But who can hope to be ≈øo happy as to be heard on this <hi>Subject,</hi> when what is here written, like <hi>the Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion</hi> ≈øhe teaches, mu≈øt be to many of you in an <hi>unknown Language,</hi> and were it worthy to ≈øpeak in your ≈øeveral

            <p>WHAT it was that hath ≈øo long made the≈øe Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>madver≈øions abortive, will appear by the Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter on the preceding Page; and therefore with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any farther appeal to other Witne≈ø≈øes, to ≈øhew that what is here publi≈øhed, is no more done to ≈øerve a turn now, than it was then written for it; What I have to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>que≈øt from every Beader, is, that it may be received with the ≈øame Sincerity with which it was fir≈øt Penned; which was in the retirement of a long Sickne≈øs, when I was ≈øeque≈øtred from my family, (the be≈øt part of it being upon other oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ca≈øions ab≈øent from me,) and had only <hi>God,</hi> and <hi>his good Spirit,</hi> and <hi>my own Con≈øcience</hi> to confer with; <hi>that Con≈øcience,</hi> which notwith≈øtanding the Prejudice with which ≈øome then, and ≈øince have loaded me, as if I <hi>had been le≈øs ≈øound in our Holy Reformed Religion,</hi> ≈øuffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red me not then to temporize with tho≈øe who ≈øate at the Helm, (to the greate≈øt of whom, I could have had as ea≈øy acce≈øs, as any others of my Brethren,) that <hi>Con≈øcience</hi> I ≈øay, which ≈øuffered me not then to temporize, and I thank my God, makes me ≈øtill above all <hi>≈øordid Flattery;</hi> and I de≈øire to ble≈øs his Holy Name, (I hope what I ≈øhall here publi≈øh will be the freer from all <hi>carnal Intere≈øt,)</hi>

            </p>
            <p>For if I have ≈øince ≈øuffered, as I am ≈øen≈øible I have, for being thought to be one whom my Great <hi>Ma≈øter then</hi> favoured, I ≈øuffered no le≈øs then, for being thought what I was, and ≈øhall always endeavour to acquit my ≈øelf therein, one <hi>of the mo≈øt firm and un≈øhaken Prote≈øtants:</hi> No, I am bold to ≈øay, whatever other Opinion <hi>that great Prince</hi> had of me, he never thought otherwi≈øe of me, than as one (let it be called <hi>Stiffne≈øs, Moro≈øene≈øs, Pride,</hi> or what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever other name <hi>ill Men</hi> have for tho≈øe, who turn not with every Wind, I am little ≈øollicitous) who knew neither how <hi>to di≈ø≈øemble or fawn.</hi> But whatever either then, or ≈øince hath befallen me, I have this to comfort my ≈øelf with, that nothing hath, nor I hope ever ≈øhall alienate my <hi>Zeal</hi> from <hi>that Truth,</hi> for which I have de≈øired always to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear: I have done it at <hi>Court,</hi> in the <hi>Univer≈øity, City,</hi> and where-ever el≈øe it lay in my <hi>way.</hi>

            <p>And if I had nothing el≈øe to plead for my Sincerity, I think the Dedication of that Sermon to his Maje≈øty, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øented to him on that <hi>very Day, and at the very point</hi> of time, when the <hi>Zealous Bigots</hi> of the other Religion were hurrying him to his fir≈øt publick appearance at their Wor≈øhip, the Dedication I ≈øay of that Sermon alone, in which the <hi>Super≈øtitions of Rome,</hi> and the <hi>Impieties of the Je≈øuits,</hi> (who were then the prevailing Faction) are ≈øo highly declared again≈øt, might be alledged for a ≈øufficient proof; I am ≈øure it was what was mo≈øt heinou≈øly re≈øented by <hi>the Party,</hi> and the <hi>Author,</hi> (as appears by what was afterwards publi≈øhed again≈øt him, in a Pamphlet of theirs, called <hi>Good advice to the Pulpits,</hi> p. 61.) had the Honour to be fonnd in that <hi>good Company,</hi> to whieh none I think will deny the ≈øtile of the <hi>Be≈øt of Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtants.</hi> But if the Cry be once rai≈øed, what's mi≈øtaken <hi>at</hi>

<pb facs="tcp:44425:18"/> that his <hi>Curio≈øity and Plea≈øure</hi> are but hereby ≈øerved.</p>
            <p>And as for <hi>the Author of Nubes Te≈øtium, who≈øe Preface</hi> chiefly occa≈øioned the≈øe Reflections, I hope he will not look upon it as an <hi>improper An≈øwer to</hi> his whole Book, to ≈øhew how <hi>tho≈øe Corruptions</hi> we blame in the <hi>Romi≈øh Church</hi> came in; how the <hi>Romi≈øh Church</hi> it ≈øelf grew to that heighth, at which it is, or hath been in any time of the <hi>Reign of Antichri≈øt;</hi> for what will it avail to urge <hi>Authorities of Fathers,</hi> Men ≈øubject to Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors as our ≈øelves, for <hi>tho≈øe Corruptions,</hi> (were they in their te≈øtimony all with him) if it be proved, that tho≈øe points he brings them to confirm, are part <hi>of tho≈øe Corruptions,</hi> for which ≈øhe is ≈øo highly to be Condemned?</p>
            <p>I would do all the Right imaginable to <hi>Antiquity,</hi> but there's a great difference between what bears the title <hi>of ≈øuch,</hi> and what really is <hi>true Antiquity.</hi> The <hi>Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers them≈øelves</hi> have they not been <hi>corrupted</hi> by the crafty <hi>Forgeries of temporizing Hypocrites?</hi> Or if they had not been <hi>corrupted,</hi> is it not enough to <hi>abate their Credit,</hi> that in what the <hi>Author brings them again≈øt us,</hi> they either differ <hi>from them≈øelves</hi> in other <hi>parts of their Writings,</hi> or, what is much more, they dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer from the Holy Scripture? The Holy Scripture I ≈øay, which mu≈øt be allowed to be <hi>the Judge in this Ca≈øe.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Nor will it ≈øerve their Turn, what they u≈øually an≈øwer us with here, that by giving thus much <hi>to Scripture,</hi> and making <hi>every one Judge of the Sen≈øe of it,</hi> we put all upon the I≈ø≈øue of <hi>a private Spirit:</hi> For we make no <hi>private Per≈øon</hi> any more a Judge here, than they do; we ≈øuppo≈øe to be able to reach the ≈øen≈øe of Scripture, all means mu≈øt be u≈øed for the attaining it; only this we are ≈øure, whether <hi>this,</hi> or the <hi>other Per≈øon</hi> hit it, or no, yet it is the true ≈øen≈øe of Scripture ought to prevail beyond the
<pb facs="tcp:44425:18"/> Authority of <hi>Councils, Fathers,</hi> or any other <hi>Doctors whatever.</hi> And whatever the <hi>Per≈øon</hi> be, who is ≈øo happy as to ≈øhew mo≈øt Rea≈øon for the <hi>Sen≈øe</hi> he gives of it, this is <hi>He,</hi> who≈øe Opinion ought to obtain.</p>
            <p>'Tis true indeed, with re≈øpect to any <hi>private Per≈øon,</hi> at the fir≈øt View, the names of <hi>Councils, and Fathers,</hi> and the like, ≈øeem to carry with them a notion of what is <hi>more publick,</hi> in Oppo≈øition to a <hi>private Spirit;</hi> but all this is but <hi>Fallacy,</hi> and no way the Inference, that ought to be made from that which is urged in this matter, <hi>viz.</hi> That <hi>no Prophe≈øy of the Scripture is of any private Interpretation,</hi> Pet. 2. 1. 20. For that is not the meaning of <hi>that Place,</hi> that <hi>one Per≈øon</hi> is <hi>more private than two,</hi> than <hi>a whole Council, than all ancient Writers</hi> whatever; but that <hi>he,</hi> and <hi>they</hi> too are <hi>Private,</hi> and their <hi>Interpretation is ≈øuch,</hi> if it agree not with the <hi>Analogy of Scripture,</hi> and the ≈øen≈øe of the <hi>Holy Spirit him≈øelf:</hi> 'Tis this Sen≈øe, taking it without re≈øpect to any Per≈øons, makes it not <hi>to be private;</hi> and ≈øo the <hi>antithe≈øis</hi> there lies, <hi>for the Prophecy came not in old time by the Will of Man; But Holy Men of God ≈øpake, as they were moved by the Holy-Gho≈øt.</hi> It is not the <hi>Will of Man,</hi> the <hi>Decrees of Councils, the Sentiments of Fathers,</hi> the <hi>pretended Infallibility of any Chair,</hi> (all this is but the <hi>Will of Man,)</hi> if they concur not with what the <hi>Holy-Gho≈øt</hi> hath ≈øpoken.</p>

            <p>I rea≈øoned al≈øo with the ≈øame Per≈øon, <hi>viz.</hi> Mon≈øieur <hi>De≈øgalle≈ønierres,</hi> formerly Mini≈øter of <hi>Mans</hi> in <hi>France,</hi> now of one of the French Churches in <hi>We≈øtmin≈øter,</hi> on ≈øome o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Heads, in which I found my ≈øelf ≈øo much to differ from that <hi>Excellent Per≈øon</hi> (his worthy Countryman <hi>Mon≈øieur Jurieu</hi> I mean,) particularly as to the ≈øen≈øe of the fir≈øt <hi>Vial,</hi> which he makes to con≈øi≈øt in <hi>the Corruptions</hi> that then broke forth in the <hi>Romi≈øh Church,</hi> whereas I am apt to think, it ought rather to be applied to the <hi>Plague</hi> that was ≈øent as the <hi>Puni≈øhment of ≈øuch Corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,</hi> in the Irruptions of the <hi>Saracens:</hi> As al≈øo in the fourth, ≈øixth, and ≈øeventh Vial, I cannot but dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer from that <hi>great Man,</hi> as may be ≈øeen in the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing di≈øcour≈øe; that I fall in with him in the ≈øecond, and third, is but agreeable to my Notion on the fir≈øt, in which if <hi>the</hi> Saracens <hi>infe≈øted</hi> the <hi>men that had the mark of the Bea≈øt</hi> in their <hi>own Country,</hi> the <hi>men that had the mark of the Brea≈øt</hi> are in judgment permitted to attempt the revenging the Injury in <hi>the Country, or Territories of the</hi> Saracens, under the ≈øecond and third Vial.

            <p>That I have con≈øulted with other Authors, ≈øuch as the <hi>Fathers, Hi≈øtories, Councils,</hi> and <hi>other Writers,</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:44425:22"/> that was but nece≈ø≈øary for the informing my ≈øelf of the <hi>State of the Romi≈øh Church,</hi> the <hi>Romi≈øh, Greek,</hi> and <hi>Mahometan Empires,</hi> with the Hi≈øtories of <hi>the ≈øeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Princes, and Countries in</hi> any <hi>of the≈øe,</hi> in order to the knowledge of tho≈øe great <hi>Events and Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtances</hi> of all ≈øorts, that might conduce to the Explain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>the≈øe Important Truths:</hi> But that I have not every where mention'd my Authorities, was at pre≈øent to ea≈øe my ≈øelf, and the Reader, as not knowing, but that a di≈øcour≈øe of this nature, if it ≈øhould happen to find acceptance in the World, might draw farther enlarge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments from me hereafter; in which it would be requi≈øite to be more exact as to the Quotations.</p>
            <p>There are I confe≈øs ≈øome <hi>other Di≈øcour≈øes</hi> on <hi>this Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject,</hi> which I cannot ≈øay I have not ≈øeen, though it was long after I had in effect <hi>fini≈øhed this Treati≈øe,</hi> and as I before ≈øaid, I was unwilling to peru≈øe any thing that might <hi>Prejudice,</hi> or be <hi>a Bar</hi> to my own <hi>free Thoughts;</hi> and it is but late that they came into my Hands, and that up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the occa≈øion of ≈øome Notions communicated by me to the <hi>Learned, and my worthy Friend, Mon≈øieur Allix,</hi> who thereupon ≈øpoke to me of <hi>Dr. Cre≈ø≈øener's, and Mr. Bever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly's</hi> Books, both of them very ingenious Men, but utterly differing in their notions from what I here pre≈øent: As al≈øo he hath given me very high Expectations of what the <hi>profoundly learned Bi≈øhop of St. A≈øaph</hi> hath, <hi>or is preparing on the≈øe Subjects,</hi> but found me ≈øtill under that <hi>Stiffne≈øs,</hi> that believing what I have here written to <hi>be of a Piece,</hi> I was unwilling ≈øo much to be acquainted with what that <hi>Excellent Prelate</hi> hath to make the World happy with, when he ≈øhall plea≈øe to make it publick.

            <p>I ≈øhall not need to ≈øay much more by way of Preface, only I wi≈øh his particular Applications to any private Prince may not be as far from the <hi>Mark</hi> as <hi>Mr. Mede</hi>'s was of <hi>Gu≈øtavus Adolphus.</hi> But it may be, for I would le≈ø≈øen no Man's Labours on this Argument, what is ≈øeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally, and in ≈øo different a manner performed by us, may be but like <hi>≈øeveral Arrows</hi> ≈øhot by ≈øeveral Hands at the <hi>≈øame Mark;</hi> if we all, or <hi>any of us hit,</hi> may that which ought to be the <hi>Mark of all our Studies,</hi> Crown all, <hi>viz.

<pb n="30" facs="tcp:44425:38"/> 
                  <hi>Ego fidenter dico, qui≈øquis ≈øe univer≈øalem Sacerdotem vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cat, vel vocari de≈øiderat, in Elatione ≈øua Antichri≈øtum praeourrit, quia ≈øuperbiendo ≈øe caeteris praeponit,</hi> l. 4. Epi≈øt. 30. I boldly ≈øay, whoever calls him≈øelf Univer≈øal Prie≈øt, or de≈øires to be ≈øo called, in his Haughtine≈øs is the forerunner of Antichri≈øt, becau≈øe in thus Priding it, he prefers him≈øelf before others. And to the ≈øame purpo≈øe may be ≈øeen, <hi>l.</hi> 4. <hi>Ep.</hi> 32. 38, 39. as al≈øo, <hi>l.</hi> 6. <hi>Ep.</hi> 2 24. 28.</p>
               <p>So then, here are two Periods which both of them an≈øwer <hi>to the letter of the Text,</hi> viz. <hi>He that leadeth into Captivity, ≈øhall go into Captivity,</hi> &amp;c. and may re≈øpectively be applied for the clearing up the matter in hand; The <hi>fir≈øt taking of</hi> Rome, <hi>Anno</hi> 410 gives us a Date, from whence if we reckon 666, we are led to One, who hath as fairly put in for the ≈øtile of <hi>Antichri≈øt,</hi> had as much of the mark of the Bea≈øt, and the number of his Name, as whoever be the Other that can be pitcht on, to vie with him among all <hi>the Children of Pride:</hi> And, as for</p>
               <p>The ≈øecond taking of <hi>Rome,</hi> Anno 455, that gives us ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Date, (and that's, as I ≈øhall afterwards ≈øhew, in a manner confined to this matter,) from whence to begin the whole <hi>Reign of Antichri≈øt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The <hi>fir≈øt</hi> is a Date that ≈øpeaks Him not to be ri≈øen, but ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øing: As 'tis not to be expected that in a <hi>moment of time</hi> he ≈øhould leap into his Greatne≈øs.</p>
               <p>The <hi>≈øecond</hi> is a Date, that ≈øhews Him ri≈øen, and beginning at lea≈øt to have the marks of Antichri≈øt upon him; like tho≈øe, that are ≈øtricken with the Plague, the Spots may be upon them, though the Di≈øea≈øe not yet come to the heighth, nor ripen'd to all the degrees of its malignity.</p>
               <p>And 'tis not unu≈øual in Scripture to predict things in <hi>≈øuch a Latitude,</hi> as that we may be able to ≈øerve our ≈øelves with <hi>any part</hi> of the ≈øeveral Periods, whereby to reconcile <hi>the Prediction and the Event;</hi> We have an in≈øtance of this <hi>Dan.</hi> 12. <hi>v.</hi> 11, 12: <hi>And from the time that the daily Sacrifice ≈øhall be taken away, and the Abomination that maketh de≈øolate ≈øet up, there ≈øhall be a thou≈øand two hundred and ninety days; Ble≈ø≈øed is he, that waiteth and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth to the thou≈øand three hundred and five and thirty days.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In the ≈øixth Ver≈øe, the Que≈øtion had been put concerning
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:44425:38"/> the Events which had been there foretold, viz. <hi>How long ≈øhall it be to the end of the≈øe Wonders?</hi> And the An≈øwer given <hi>by the man clothed in linnen, was, that it ≈øhould be for a time, times, and an half,</hi> this was the certain time (for 'tis confirm'd by a mo≈øt ≈øolemn Oath) <hi>for him,</hi> of whom the <hi>Holy Gho≈øt</hi> had been ≈øpeaking, <hi>ch.</hi> 11. 31. <hi>to accompli≈øh to ≈øcatter the power of the holy people:</hi> But <hi>Daniel</hi> is ≈øtill in a doubt, and profe≈ø≈øes him≈øelf not <hi>to under≈øtand this, when he heard it,</hi> and therefore he puts the Que≈øtion again, <hi>v.</hi> 8. <hi>O my Lord, what ≈øhall be the end of the≈øe things?</hi> To which the return is, <hi>v.</hi> 11. And <hi>from the time that the daily Sacrifice ≈øhall be taken away, and the Abomination that maketh de≈øolate ≈øet up, there ≈øhall be a thou≈øand two hundred and ninety days. Ble≈ø≈øed is he that waiteth, and cometh to the thou≈øand three hundred and five and thirty days.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now what is the rea≈øon of this difference in the reply? To me it ≈øeems to be this; the former que≈øtion is put by one Angel to another, who were no ways concerned <hi>in ha≈øtening</hi> or <hi>deferring the</hi> event, and therefore the <hi>certain</hi> time in Gods Kalender is there prefixt. The <hi>latter question</hi> is put by <hi>Daniel</hi> in behalf of the Church, to whom good things are promis'd, and Evils threatned under the conditions and mea≈øures of God's dealing with his people; <hi>i. e.</hi> ≈øo as to take effect according to the <hi>Repentance,</hi> or <hi>Impenitency</hi> of tho≈øe therein concern'd; according too, <hi>to the ≈øeveral</hi> degrees by which great Events are to be accompli≈øh'd, that ≈øo <hi>the Faith and patience of the Saints</hi> may be accordingly (as I may ≈øay) <hi>working with Providence, and preparing them</hi> for what in his Wi≈øe Councils, an All≈øeeing God hath ≈øo ≈øuited to that varie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty there is in humane affairs; and therefore not without a <hi>latitude</hi> for their <hi>beginning</hi> or <hi>ending: And ≈øo the Rule is,</hi> Habak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kuk 2. 3. <hi>For the Vi≈øion is for an appointed time, but at the end it ≈øhall ≈øpeak, and not lie, though it tarry, wait for it, becau≈øe it will ≈øurely come, it will not tarry.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But then, <hi>if Antichri≈øt were come before the</hi> 500<hi>th year of Chri≈øt,</hi> what was there did then appear in the World, which could in any ≈øort an≈øwer the black Character the Apo≈øtle gives of <hi>him,</hi> 2 <hi>The≈ø≈ø.</hi> 2. v. 4, 8, 9, 10? To this, I an≈øwer, That as the Apo≈øtle tells them, to whom he there writes, <hi>That the My≈øtery of Iniquity already works,</hi> there is no doubt,
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:44425:39"/> but that he <hi>was born:</hi> (This My≈øtery had not been ≈øo <hi>long conceiving</hi> to <hi>bring forth Nothing)</hi> however he had not then attain'd the <hi>mature age</hi> of <hi>this Man of Sin, and Son of Perdition.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And there will be little rea≈øon to think otherwi≈øe, if we con≈øider, that agreeable to the three Names, by which <hi>the Holy Gho≈øt</hi> ≈øets out the <hi>Reign of Antichri≈øt,</hi> I mean of <hi>Sodom,</hi> Revel. 11. 4. of <hi>Egypt,</hi> Revel. 11. 8. and of <hi>Babylon,</hi> Revel. 17. 5. the fir≈øt to ≈øignifie <hi>that Corruption of Manners,</hi> the ≈øe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond <hi>that Tyranny,</hi> the third that <hi>Super≈øtition and Idolatry,</hi> which was then to obtain; there was ≈øomething of all the≈øe to make out that <hi>Apo≈øta≈øie,</hi> or <hi>falling away,</hi> which was to precede his coming.</p>
               <p>And here not to lead the <hi>Author</hi> beyond his own <hi>Collection of Primitive Fathers,</hi> I could ≈øhew him <hi>St. Augu≈øtin, St. Hie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rome, St. Chry≈øo≈øtome,</hi> with <hi>many others,</hi> giving Te≈øtimony in this matter, in their ≈øeveral <hi>Invectives again≈øt tho≈øe Enormities,</hi> which were ≈øo predominant among the <hi>Clergy,</hi> with tho≈øe <hi>many burden≈øom Rites and Ceremonies,</hi> which were introduced, with the <hi>Adoration</hi> and <hi>Interce≈ø≈øion of Saints,</hi> and the like, ≈øuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient to di≈øcredit the <hi>Purity of the Church;</hi> and at lea≈øt, Evidence that <hi>Antichri≈øt</hi> was at hand.</p>
               <p>I could ≈øhew, where <hi>St. Hierome</hi> gives <hi>Rome</hi> no other Name than that of <hi>Babylon,</hi> and reproves her for the ≈øins of <hi>Sodom,</hi> viz. <hi>Pride, Fullne≈øs of Bread, and abundance of Idlene≈øs,</hi> and a <hi>refu≈øing to ≈øtrengthen the hand of the poor and needy,</hi> Ezek. 16. 49. and ≈øome degree, at lea≈øt, of an <hi>Egyptian Tyranny,</hi> (what hath been already ob≈øerv'd of <hi>Leo Magnus,</hi> will go a great way in the proof hereof) <hi>in that high hand,</hi> with which ≈øhe began then to carry things <hi>in the Church.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>How far they were gone in <hi>Super≈øtition and Idolatry, Theodoret,</hi> whom the Author ≈øo often appeals to <hi>in his Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lection,</hi> will ≈øufficiently inform us, in <hi>his eighth book de Graec. Affect. Curat.</hi> where 'tis his profe≈øt bu≈øine≈øs to invite the <hi>Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens</hi> to change the <hi>wor≈øhip of their Pagan Heroes, and Deified Per≈øons,</hi> into that <hi>of the Martyrs.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>To this I might add the Te≈øtimony of <hi>Lactantius, Antonius Eremita, Hilarius</hi> and <hi>Epiphanius,</hi> with <hi>Salvian,</hi> and many others: For 'tis no difficulty to make good the Charge.</p>
               <pb n="33" facs="tcp:44425:39"/>
               <p>Only the <hi>advantage</hi> the Author hopes for from it, is, That it being <hi>≈øo early, may ju≈øtifie him</hi> in urging this it ≈øelf as <hi>matter of Antiquity;</hi> the <hi>U≈øe</hi> we make of it, is to ≈øatisfie Him, that the≈øe <hi>Errors, and Enormities</hi> did ≈øo ≈øoon obtain, not that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cau≈øe <hi>they ≈øo ≈øoon obtain'd,</hi> they were therefore the more <hi>ju≈øti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fiable.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>So then, there's no que≈øtion, but <hi>Antichri≈øt</hi> was <hi>then born,</hi> though not arrived <hi>to the adult, and mature age</hi> of the <hi>Man of Sin:</hi>
               </p>
               <p>For that, as we before ob≈øerv'd, was to be reckon'd from another <hi>Epocha,</hi> viz. That of the fir≈øt <hi>taking of</hi> Rome, <hi>Anno</hi> 410. And but rea≈øonable it ≈øhould be ≈øo, <hi>He, who let, being to be taken out of the way,</hi> 2 The≈ø≈ø. 2. 7. before the <hi>other Bea≈øt</hi> (as He is ≈øtiled <hi>Revel.</hi> 13. 10.) <hi>could come up out of the Earth:</hi> For, 'twas the Anarchy, as St. <hi>Chry≈øo≈øtom</hi> expre≈ø≈øes it, that ≈øhould make way for his U≈øurpation, as <hi>de facto</hi> it did, the Bi≈øhop of <hi>Rome</hi> ≈øtill holding his own, and indeed gaining by the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Calamity:</p>
               <p>Nor is there any thing, which the Holy Gho≈øt him≈øelf hath more clearly pointed out, then this very <hi>Epocha:</hi> For what are tho≈øe reflections, I took notice of before, viz. <hi>If any man have an Ear, let him hear,</hi> Revel. 13. 9. and, in the clo≈øe of the <hi>tenth</hi> ver≈øe, <hi>Here is the Patience, and the Faith of the Saints,</hi> which ≈øets <hi>the Period</hi> to the <hi>Roman Empire,</hi> and the <hi>Sufferings of the Chri≈øtians</hi> under <hi>it,</hi> but <hi>to quicken</hi> our attention, as to what is thereby immediately u≈øher'd in, <hi>≈øo to lead us</hi> on to a more ≈øtrict Ob≈øervation of what follows? which being the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øcription <hi>of Antichri≈øt, that other Bea≈øt,</hi> which was to grow up upon the <hi>Ruins of the Roman Empire,</hi> and being in effect the ≈øame, with what is foretold of him in that foremention'd 2 <hi>The≈ø≈ø.</hi> 2. 7, 8. cannot (e≈øpecially the <hi>Holy Gho≈øt</hi> again point<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to it, <hi>v.</hi> 18. in the≈øe words, <hi>Here is Wi≈ødom,)</hi> but guide us to ≈øome <hi>notable Epocha</hi> of his Reign to be calculated from thence:</p>
               <p>And what was that, but the very time, when He ≈øhould, (as St. <hi>Paul</hi> had foretold, and I have before taken notice of) <hi>exalt him≈øelf above all that is called God, or that is wor≈øhipt</hi> (<gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF" extent="1 span">

               </p>
               <p>As to the fir≈øt of the≈øe, <hi>viz. The fixing the time for the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velation of Antichri≈øt,</hi> 'tis to be con≈øidered from whence the Calculation is to be taken, and where to end.</p>
               <p>As to the time from <hi>whence it was to begin;</hi> the Angel tells us, 'twas <hi>from the time that the daily Sacrifice ≈øhould be taken away, and the Abomination that maketh de≈øolate, ≈øet up.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And when was that?</p>
               <p>We have the Hi≈øtorical Relation of it, <hi>Maccab.</hi> 1. 54. <q rend="inline">Now the fifteenth day of the Month <hi>Ca≈øleu,</hi> in the hundred forty fifth Year, they ≈øet up the Abomination of De≈øolation upon the Altar, and builded Idol-Altars throughout the Cities of <hi>Judah,</hi> on every ≈øide; <hi>ver≈ø</hi> 55. And burnt Incen≈øe at the doors of their Hou≈øes, and in the Streets: <hi>ver≈ø.</hi> 56.

And who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øoever was found with any of the Books of the Te≈øtament, or if any con≈øented to the Law, the Kings Commandment was, that they ≈øhould put him to Death; <hi>ver.</hi> 58. Thus did they by their Authority to the <hi>I≈øraelites</hi> every Month, to as many as were found in the Cities:</q> Which happened to be before Chri≈øt, 167 Years. Now, take 167 out of 1290, and you leave 1123. But as the learned <hi>Mede</hi> ob≈øerves, we are not to take it from the fir≈øt, but any of the Years of the Profanation of the Temple, which la≈øting 6 Years, if we take it from the middle, will fall on 1120, the very Year when the forementioned Treati≈øe was ≈øet out by the <hi>Walden≈øes,</hi> or <hi>Albigenfes,</hi> declaring Antichri≈øt to be come: Or,</p>
               <p>If we under≈øtand it of <hi>the Time his Reign was to continue,</hi> then 'twill not point out ≈øo much to the time of the <hi>≈øetting up the abomination that maketh de≈øolate,</hi> by <hi>Antiochus Epiphanes; as to</hi>
                  <pb n="71" facs="tcp:44425:59"/> 
                  <hi>that time,</hi> whereof the other was the Type, <hi>i. e.</hi> As we ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øerved before, to the time when Antichri≈øt, (for of him, <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiochus</hi> is generally agreed to the be Type) <hi>began to exalt him≈øelf,</hi> which we ≈øhewed to belong to the times of <hi>Leo Magnus,</hi> and to fall in with the time, the <hi>ten Horns,</hi> or <hi>ten Kings were to take their Kingdoms,</hi> and that was in, or about 455. From whence reckoning 1290, we are brought to the 1745<hi>th.</hi> year after Chri≈øt.</p>
               <p>But this exceeding 1260, the Years the <hi>Angel</hi> had before mentioned by 30: If we take out the ≈øaid 30, will leave 1715: Concerning which, it may be worth our while to enquire, whether in likelihood that be not the time for the <hi>expiration of the Reign of Antichri≈øt?</hi> (A Period which we are led to from the other mea≈øures of Prophetick time; which we ≈øhall have occa≈øion to take notice of in this fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing Di≈øcour≈øe.)</p>
               <p>As, whether with re≈øpect to the <hi>Jews,</hi> for whom <hi>Daniel</hi> there puts the Que≈øtion (a thing never yet taken notice of by any, whom I have yet met with) the Year 1745, be not a likely Epocha for <hi>their return to the true Wor≈øhip of God in its full Purity?</hi> As the other is for <hi>the downfal of Antichri≈øt,</hi> and the <hi>beginning of tho≈øe happy Times to them,</hi> and the <hi>fulne≈øs of the Gentiles,</hi> which ≈øhall be in very great Glory at this Period. As al≈øo,</p>
               <p>Whether from thence reckoning the <hi>Millennium</hi> to en≈øue, we have not the <hi>full Period of the Worlds duration.</hi> Or,</p>
               <p>If we take it in the An≈øwer <hi>the Angel</hi> had before given to <hi>Daniel, chap.</hi> 8. 14. Of 2300 Days, reckoning them from <hi>the time,</hi> when <hi>Daniel</hi> ≈øaw the Vi≈øion, which was, (as <hi>Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vi≈øius</hi> gives it us in his Chronology) <hi>Anno Mundi,</hi> 3393: or before Chri≈øt, 555, we fall again upon the ≈øame number of 1745, for the time of the Vi≈øion concerning the <hi>Daily Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice, and the tran≈øgre≈ø≈øion of De≈øolation to give both the Sanctua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, and the Ho≈øt to be trodden under foot,</hi> ver≈ø. 14. And then ≈øhall <hi>the Sanctuary be clean≈øed:</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Which being, as I have ob≈øerved, the an≈øwer given to <hi>Daniel,</hi> Sollicitous of the Welfare of his People, may very well point out the time for their being called again, and to be received into the Enjoyment of tho≈øe Glorious things,
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:44425:60"/> which were promi≈øed them in the <hi>times of the Me≈ø≈øias.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And the Calculation of it is thus, 555 before Chri≈øt, ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to 1745 after Chri≈øt, gives 2300; the Time a≈ø≈øigned for the fulfilling of tho≈øe things by the Angel.</p>
               <p>And whatever we are to under≈øtand by that Phra≈øe, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it relate to the <hi>Millenium</hi> ≈øo much ≈øpoken of; <hi>or the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øurrection</hi> foretold, <hi>ver≈ø.</hi> 1, 2, 3.

But go thou thy way till the End be; for thou ≈øhalt re≈øt, and ≈øtand in thy Lot at the end of thy Days.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But then this number exceeding the other in the ≈øame place of <hi>Daniel,</hi> viz. <hi>Dan.</hi> 12. 11, 12. by 45. If we take out the ≈øaid 45, will leave us to con≈øider what may hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen with relation to that People in the Year 1700: And the i≈ø≈øue of <hi>the Wars</hi> that are at pre≈øent between the Impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riali≈øts, and the <hi>Turks,</hi> with tho≈øe other <hi>Commotions</hi> which may be very ≈øhortly expected in the Ea≈øtern part of the World, will in all likelihood explain this.</p>

               <head>CHAP. VIII. Some Remarks nece≈ø≈øary to be premi≈øed for the clearing up what will afterwards be ≈øaid of the ≈øeveral Vials.</head>
               <p n="1">1. THat as to the <hi>time</hi> of pouring out the Vials, it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be till <hi>Antichri≈øt</hi> ≈øhould be ≈øo far advanced, as to have made <hi>an Image to the Bea≈øt, that had the wound by the Sword, and did live, Revel.</hi> 13, 14.

                  <hi>his Name, and wor≈øhipped his Image,</hi> that the <hi>fir≈øt Vial</hi> was to be poured out. <hi>Rev.</hi> 16. 2.</p>
               <p n="2">2. That it is not nece≈ø≈øary the <hi>Trumpets and Vials</hi> (it being their ≈øeveral Objects, and the di≈øtinct Capacities of tho≈øe on whom they were to take place, in which they chiefly differ) ≈øhould be all of them re≈øtrained to di≈øtinct times: Some of the Trumpets undoubtedly had ≈øounded before any of the Vials were to be poured out; but when the time came for the≈øe to be poured out, they might be co-incident ≈øome of them with one another. As for the purpo≈øe;</p>
               <p>The <hi>fir≈øt Trumpet,</hi> and <hi>fir≈øt Vial</hi> I take to be quite different; as I do al≈øo the <hi>≈øecond, third, and fourth Trumpets</hi> from the <hi>Vials;</hi> However in the manner of expre≈ø≈øing them, they fall in very much with the <hi>≈øecond, third, and fourth Vials:</hi> But then for the <hi>fifth Trumpet,</hi> and <hi>three fir≈øt Vials,</hi> I ≈øee not why they may not ≈øynchronize.</p>
               <p>The <hi>fourth and fifth Vials</hi> ≈øeem to ≈øtand by them≈øelves.</p>
               <p>The <hi>≈øixth Trumpet,</hi> and <hi>≈øixth Vial</hi> agree very much in <hi>Time,</hi> and <hi>Subject,</hi> though they differ in their <hi>re≈øpective Ends:</hi> The <hi>one</hi> being to give the Secular <hi>Antichri≈øtian</hi> Power its great Blow; the <hi>other</hi> to bring down the <hi>degenerate, Eccle≈øia≈øtical or Papal Power,</hi> and with both to advance the great work of the <hi>Jews Conver≈øion,</hi> and bringing in the <hi>fulne≈øs of the Gentiles:</hi> The <hi>≈øeventh Trumpet,</hi> and <hi>≈øeventh Vial</hi> fully compleat the Ruin of all the pre≈øent Enemies of the Church, and what is the great Mortification to them all, are to bring in that Kingdom of Chri≈øt in its full Glory and Extent, which from thence is always to prevail. As al≈øo,</p>
               <p n="3">3. That we pretend not to be ≈øo exact in the <hi>≈øeveral Vials,</hi> as if what is given in the <hi>Prediction</hi> could ≈øuit with no other <hi>Events;</hi> only where the Series of things corre≈øponds with the Text, as it ≈øeems to do in what we have a≈ø≈øigned, and an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øwers the great end of the Prophe≈øie, we are apt to think what is offered, ought to be received with the greate≈øt Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dor by all lovers of Truth.</p>
               <p>For I will not ≈øo in≈øi≈øt on any thing of this nature, as to pre≈øume that this, and no other may be the ≈øen≈øe of the <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øpective Vials,</hi> I know things in Scripture are delivered ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to that of the P≈øalmi≈øt, <hi>(P≈ø.</hi> 119. 96. <hi>Thy Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi>

                  <hi>is exceeding broad,)</hi> with <hi>that Latitude,</hi> that many times there is not only a <hi>My≈øtical</hi> and <hi>Literal,</hi> but a <hi>general and particular</hi> Interpretation of the ≈øame Truth, and as in the Type, what <hi>particularly</hi> related to <hi>Egypt,</hi> and its Plagues, may gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally, and in the Antitype be verified of all the Enemies of the Church; As What relates to the <hi>whole Church,</hi> may likewi≈øe be veri≈øied to every <hi>particular Chri≈øtian;</hi> and this is no ≈ømall part of the Divine Wi≈ødom, (if I may ≈øo ≈øay) to give every one his own Portion; nor will I therefore conte≈øt it with any, that <hi>tho≈øe and no other Events,</hi> than what I ≈øhall point to, can be under≈øtood by the <hi>≈øeveral Vials,</hi> but leave it to the Judgment of. every di≈øcreet Reader, whether tho≈øe that ≈øhall be a≈ø≈øigned, if they are not exclu≈øive of all other Interpretations, yet do not them≈øeves however reach the matter in hand.</p>
               <p>And the Truth is, if we are ≈øo happy as to be in the right, as to the fir≈øt <hi>commencing</hi> and <hi>ending</hi> of <hi>the≈øe Vials,</hi> (now the rea≈øon of the thing is our be≈øt guide here.)</p>

               <p>If ≈øo happy as to have ≈øettled the Period for his coming to his heighth, to that maturity, wherein he is the <hi>Man of Sin, and Son of Perdition,</hi> by beginning to reckon for it at 410.</p>
               <p>If ≈øo happy as to have hit upon the Period, which mu≈øt put en end to his Reign, 'twill be ≈øufficient that in order thereunto, we have pointed out tho≈øe Judgments which can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be denied to have fallen upon him, and that in ≈øuch order of time, as to have given to each a due di≈øtance, and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtinction in the ≈øeveral ages, wherein they were veri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied.</p>
               <p>And that herein we may give <hi>≈øome probable Scheme,</hi> it <hi>may not be ami≈øs previous</hi> to what we ≈øhall offer on the <hi>≈øe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Vials,</hi> which are called the <hi>la≈øt Plagues, Revel.</hi> 15. 1.

               <head>CHAP. IX. What times in all likelihood the <hi>Seals,</hi> and <hi>Trumpets,</hi> and <hi>Vials</hi> under them, point out?</head>
               <p>NOW the≈øe ≈øeem to be in this Order:</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The fir≈øt of the≈øe Seals</hi> ≈øhews us Chri≈øt ≈øetting forth as <hi>a great Conqueror,</hi> and the <hi>Conque≈øt</hi> that goes out with Him, is to accompany him through all the <hi>other Seals;</hi> ≈øo that that is fixed to no particular time, but runs through all the other changes that were to ≈øucceed in the Church, until it ≈øhould with him be con≈øummated in Glory.</p>
               <p>The <hi>three next</hi> carry us through the ten <hi>famous Per≈øecutions,</hi> the <hi>la≈øt</hi> of which was ≈øo memorable, that the <hi>Egyptians</hi> from thence took one of their <hi>Aeras,</hi> calling it <hi>Aera Martymum:</hi> 'Twas that begun under <hi>Diocle≈øian,</hi> it began in <hi>Egypt</hi> on <hi>Ea≈øter-Day,</hi> where in one Month ≈øeventeen Thou≈øand were Slaugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered. <hi>Quippe certatim glorio≈øa in certamina ruebatur, multoque avidi√πs tum Martyria glorio≈øis mortibus quaerebantur quam po≈øtea Epi≈øcopatus pravis ambitionibus appelebantur;</hi> Men run in in Crouds into the glorious Conflicts, and Martyrdoms were more earhe≈øtly ≈øought by glorious Deaths, than afterwards Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øhopricks were pur≈øued by bafe Ambitions. Of which, <hi>Sulpitius Severus</hi> thus writes, <hi>nullis unquam bellis mundus ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gis exhau≈øtus, neque majore unquam triumpho vicimus quam cum decem annorum ≈øtragibus vinci non potuimus;</hi> The World was never more Exhau≈øted by any Warrs, nor did we ever Conquer by greater Triumph, than when we could not be conquered with the ≈ølaughters of ten Years. Then it was the <hi>Thaebean</hi> Legion gained their Honour under <hi>Maximian</hi>'s decimation: Then it was here in <hi>Britanny,</hi> there was almo≈øt a general exci≈øion of all the Chri≈øtians, and among them the
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:44425:64"/> ≈øo famous St. <hi>Alban</hi> ≈øuffered Martyrdom; in a word, the Per≈øecution was ≈øo great throughout all the World, that their Name was well nigh extinct, and a Coin ≈øtampt by <hi>Diocle≈øian,</hi> with this In≈øcription; <hi>Nomine Chri≈øtianum deleto qui remp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>evertebant,</hi> the name of the Chri≈øtians being quite blotted out, who did overturn the Commonwealth.</p>
               <p>And how proper an Introduction was this to the <hi>next Seal,</hi> which ≈øhews the <hi>Souls under the Altar, crying with a loud Voice,</hi> Revel. 6. 10. <hi>Saying, how long O Lord, Holy and True, do≈øt thou not judge, and avenge our Blood on them that dwell on the Earth?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The effect whereof, I take to be <hi>Chap.</hi> 13. 10.

               <p>And this is, what I take to be the bu≈øine≈øs of the <hi>≈øixth Seal,</hi> Rev. 6. 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17. After which, till the fir≈øt taking of <hi>Rome,</hi> I take to intervene that <hi>little Sea≈øon,</hi> which the <hi>Souls under the Altar are bid to re≈øt, until their fellow-Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants al≈øo, and their Brethern, that ≈øhould be killed as they were, ≈øhould he fulfilled:</hi> Which happened in the Per≈øecutions of <hi>Julian, Valens, Valentinian</hi> the ≈øecond, with the many Cruel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties exerci≈øed on the Orthodox by the <hi>Arrians, &amp;c.</hi> in return whereof, <hi>the cry of the Souls under the Altar</hi> is fully an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øwered, and the overthrow of the <hi>Roman Empire</hi> wholly ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compli≈øhed, <hi>Rev.</hi> 13. 10. at lea≈øt ≈øo far, as from that time ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver again to make <hi>Rome</hi> the Seat of it.</p>
               <p>'Tis true indeed, that the <hi>Eu≈øtern</hi> part of the Empire (for ≈øo it happened upon the Death of <hi>Constantine</hi> to be divided, <hi>viz.</hi> into the <hi>Ea≈øtern</hi> and <hi>We≈øtern</hi> Empire, fir≈øt under <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtantius</hi> and <hi>Con≈øtans,</hi> though ≈øoon united again, as 'twas again divided under <hi>Honorius</hi> and <hi>Arcadius)</hi> was of longer continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, as not expiring till the year 1453, or thereabout, though much le≈ø≈øened long before that time <hi>in its extent, viz.</hi> from the Year 800. or thereabout; when <hi>Carolus Magnus</hi> began the new Empire of the <hi>We≈øt;</hi> ≈øoon after which, <hi>viz.

                  <hi>AND I heard a great Voice out of the Temple, ≈øaying to the ≈øeven Angels, Go your ways, and pour out the Vials of the Wrath of God upon the Earth.</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>The Voice out of the Temple</hi> ≈øpeaks it to be from God, and to re≈øpect the <hi>Affairs of the Church;</hi> and its being ≈øaid to be a <hi>great Voice,</hi> ≈øhews the <hi>Terrour</hi> it brings with it, and the <hi>cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Succe≈øs,</hi> the things it ≈øpeaks are to have, and that 'tis a <hi>Voice</hi> that will be heard.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The Angels being bid to go their ways, and pour out the Vials,</hi> makes it evident that it is not <hi>the Church in its Purity,</hi> (the <hi>Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple</hi> from whence this Voice comes,) that is to be the <hi>Subject of the≈øe Plagues.</hi>

                  <hi>AND the fir≈øt</hi> (Angel) <hi>went and poured out his Vial upon the Earth, and there fell a noi≈øom, and grievous Sore upon the Men which had the mark of the Bea≈øt, and upon them which wor≈øhipped his Image.</hi> Revel. 16. 2.</p>
               <p>By <hi>Earth</hi> here, as is ju≈øt now ob≈øerved, is ≈øignified what is op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>po≈øite to <hi>Heaven,</hi> ≈øo that if <hi>Heaven</hi> ≈øignifies the <hi>Church,</hi> or <hi>Eccle≈øie≈øtical State, Earth</hi> will ≈øignifie what is <hi>Secular,</hi> and <hi>Properly of this World;</hi> and if ≈øo, it will intimate <hi>this Vial</hi> to concern in the fir≈øt place the <hi>whole Roman Empire,</hi> the <hi>Secu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar, Earthly,</hi> and <hi>Temporal Power</hi> there in Being; but ≈øo that (as it follows) it ≈øhall in particular fall on tho≈øe of <hi>its Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, which had the mark of the Bea≈øt, and which wor≈øhipped his Image.</hi> And that requires, that we con≈øider here, 1. what is meant by the <hi>Bea≈øt?</hi> 2.

               <p n="1">1. What is meant <hi>by the Bea≈øt?</hi>
                  <pb n="87" facs="tcp:44425:67"/> Now 'tis evident that by the <hi>Bea≈øt</hi> is to be under≈øtood that <hi>Power,</hi> which ro≈øe up in the place of what was <hi>Imperial:</hi> For ≈øo 'tis prophe≈øied 2 <hi>The≈ø≈ø.</hi> 2. 7, 8.

                  </gap> the <hi>Image of the former;</hi> for ≈øo he who was to come up in his place, <hi>viz.</hi> the <hi>Pope,</hi> is: The name of <hi>Emperor</hi> indeed he takes not upon him, but <hi>he exerci≈øes all the Power of the fir≈øt Bea≈øt before him,</hi> ver. 12. <hi>i. e.</hi> So over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rules and controuls the <hi>Secular Power,</hi> as to make it ≈øub≈øer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vient to what he hath po≈ø≈øe≈ø≈øed him≈øelf of, <hi>i. e.</hi> To what is <hi>≈øpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual:</hi> He <hi>exerci≈øes all his Power before him,</hi>

                  </gap>. As 'tis in <hi>his Pre≈øence</hi> under the <hi>≈øhew,</hi> and <hi>covert of his Authority</hi> he doth it: As he permits him to have the name of doing that, wherein he is only his <hi>Tool</hi> to excute ≈øuch Sentences, as he <hi>(the Pope)</hi> ≈øhall fir≈øt decree; for there's the whole juggle of delivering up Offenders to the <hi>Secular Power,</hi> which is to proceed again≈øt them without any farther Tryal, or Cognizance of the cau≈øe, for which they are thus remitted to the <hi>Civil Magistrate.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And that it is added, <hi>He cau≈øeth the Earth, and them that dwell therein to wor≈øhip the fir≈øt Bea≈øt, who≈øe deadly Wound was healed;</hi> this mu≈øt be under≈øtood by con≈øidering <hi>what his deadly Wound was,</hi> Which in all probability was the blow he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived in having <hi>Pagani≈øm and Idolatry</hi> (for to that <hi>Wor≈øhipping</hi> will mo≈øt properly relate) beaten down; but not without including al≈øo that Supream Power, from whence he was ca≈øt down at the di≈ø≈øolution of the <hi>We≈øtern</hi> Empire: Indeed both, <hi>i. e.</hi> The <hi>Imperial Power,</hi> and <hi>Idolatry</hi> under it, went toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, (excepting for the ≈øhort breathing time Chri≈øtianity had under <hi>Con≈øtantine,</hi> and the re≈øtoring <hi>either</hi> or <hi>both</hi> in <hi>their Image,</hi> mu≈øt denote, as the <hi>≈øhew of Power</hi> to which the <hi>Bea≈øt</hi> again revived after that <hi>deadly Blow</hi> received by the <hi>Goths, Hunns, and Vandals,</hi> ≈øo that <hi>≈øhew of Idolatry,</hi> i. e.

               <p>So then it is evident, what we are to under≈øtand by <hi>the Bea≈øt?</hi> i. e. the <hi>Supream Power,</hi> as 'tis now u≈øurped by the <hi>Pope,</hi> though in the ≈øhew of it given <hi>to him,</hi> who wears the name of <hi>Emperor,</hi> rai≈øed to that <hi>Stile</hi> and <hi>Power</hi> by the <hi>Pope</hi> (for ≈øo <hi>Carolus Magnus,</hi> and his Succe≈ø≈øors were) and upheld therein in order to that <hi>Power,</hi> which he and his followers have from that time exerci≈øed before him.

               <p>The Controver≈øie, as is already ob≈øerved, began about the Year 725, and la≈øted till about 840, and gives the faire≈øt Ri≈øe imaginable for our Conjecture of what was the Bu≈øine≈øs of <hi>the fir≈øt Vial,</hi> viz. <hi>the Judgment</hi> that overtook this <hi>great Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption of the Church,</hi> in the <hi>Irruptions of the Saracens,</hi> the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter more ≈øtrictly now to be enquired into.</p>
               <p>And for this, methinks we have a very proper Key in what the <hi>Holy Gho≈øt</hi> a≈ø≈øigns for the <hi>Subject of this Plague, as it was to be upon the Men which had the Mark of the Bea≈øt, and wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øhipped his Image;</hi> which if to be under≈øtood of tho≈øe who had given up them≈øelves to <hi>that Idolatry,</hi> or <hi>Image-wor≈øhip</hi>

                  <hi>AND the ≈øecond Angel poured out his Vial upon the Sea, and it became as the Blood of a dead Man, and every living Soul died in the Sea.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The <hi>Sea</hi> is the great <hi>Confluence of Waters,</hi> and <hi>Waters,</hi> we know, the Angel interpreting it to St. <hi>John, Rev.</hi> 17. 15. ≈øignifie <hi>Peoples, Multitudes, Nations,</hi> and <hi>Tongues;</hi> which being ≈øaid to become as the <hi>Blood of a dead Man, and every Soul dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in it,</hi> may import very <hi>great Saughters, and univer≈øal Blood<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øhed</hi> among tho≈øe, who are to be the Subjects of this <hi>Vial.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now what can better interpret this, than the <hi>Cru≈øado's,</hi> or <hi>Holy Wars,</hi> wherein ≈øo much Blood was ≈øpilt? And to this the Series of Hi≈øtory naturally leads us; for if in the pouring out of the <hi>former Vial,</hi> the <hi>Saracens</hi> invade the <hi>We≈øtern Empire,</hi> and tho≈øe therein (for 'tis ob≈øervable, indeed it could not be otherwi≈øe, it being commanded them, <hi>that they ≈øhould not hurt any but only tho≈øe who have not the Seal of God in their Foreheads,</hi> Rev. 9. 4. That in all the Inva≈øions and Wars the <hi>Saracens</hi> or <hi>Turks</hi> have made, that they have never bent their Force again≈øt tho≈øe who di≈øclaimed the Idolatries of <hi>Antichri≈øt,</hi> tho≈øe they were, again≈øt whom, neither then nor in later times they ≈øeem to have had their Commi≈ø≈øion) <hi>that had the mark of the Bea≈øt, and wor≈øhipped his Image,</hi> 'tis but in a way of Retaliation that tho≈øe <hi>who had the Mark of the Bea≈øt, and wor≈øhipped his Image,</hi> ≈øhould carry back the War into the Territories of the <hi>Saracens,</hi> to revenge their former Incur≈øions, to <hi>recover Pale≈øtine, with Jeru≈øalem, and the Temple of the Sepulcher</hi> out of the hands of the Infidels.</p>
               <p>Accordingly <hi>Urban the Second</hi> in pur≈øuit of what he knew to have been often attempted by his Predece≈ø≈øor, <hi>Gregory</hi> the Seventh, (but wherein he was hindred by the Factions
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:44425:70"/> of Schi≈ømaticks, and ≈øeveral Wars, (≈øo <hi>Baronius</hi> tells us <hi>Anno</hi> 1090,) and at the in≈øtance of <hi>Alexius</hi> the Emperor of <hi>Con≈øtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinople,</hi> who≈øe Letters had been lately read in the Council of <hi>Placentia,</hi> declares the fir≈øt Expedition in the Council of <hi>Clare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mont</hi> called chiefly for this work; the ≈øecond Canon whereof was this, <hi>Quicunque pro≈øol√¢ devotione, non pro, Honoris vel lucri adeptione, ad liberandam Eccle≈øiam Dei Jeru≈øalem profectus fuerit, iter illud pro omni poenitenti√¢ reputetur: Who≈øoever out of meer Devotion, and not for the getting of Honour, or Gain, ≈øhall go to</hi> Jeru≈øalem <hi>to deliver the Church of God, let that Journey be accounted in the ≈øtead of all Repentance whate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver;</hi> and for the farther encouragement of tho≈øe who ≈øhould un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertake the Expedition, in one of the Speeches he makes on this occa≈øion, as <hi>Malmsburien≈øis</hi> relates it, 'tis decreed by him, <hi>omnia bona eorum, qui Hiero≈øolymas pergunt, ≈øemper &amp; ubique e≈ø≈øe ≈øalva in pace, &amp; treuga, quou≈øque redierint: That all the Goods of tho≈øe who go to</hi> Jeru≈øalem <hi>≈øhould always and every where be ≈øafe, in Peace and Truce, till they ≈øhall return.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And now what ha≈øtening is there to <hi>this Holy War,</hi> in which they ≈øhould thus merit the Pardon of all their Sins, and be ≈øe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure that all their Goods and Po≈ø≈øe≈ø≈øions ≈øhould be kept in ≈øafe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty for them? <hi>≈øuch</hi> (≈øaith <hi>Baronius)</hi> were <hi>the Crouds</hi> of tho≈øe who li≈øted their Names, that 'twas nece≈ø≈øary to dehort <hi>them</hi> from going, who≈øe <hi>Age</hi> and <hi>Health</hi> were not fit for military <hi>Service:</hi> Very great indeed were their numbers; <hi>Malmsbu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rien≈øis</hi> thinks that if the ≈øeveral Armies had been entred in one Mu≈øter-Roll, they would have made ≈øixty hundred thou≈øand: He that ≈øhall con≈øider this, with the great Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cruits that were afterwards made in the continuance of tho≈øe Wars, and the ≈ømall number of tho≈øe who ever returned to give an account of their great Exploits there, will not at all wonder that the Holy-Gho≈øt ≈øhould plea≈øe to expre≈øs it by <hi>a Sea of Blood.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Indeed <hi>Urban,</hi> as well as his Predece≈ø≈øor <hi>Gregory</hi> the ≈øe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venth, (who fir≈øt de≈øigned the Expedition, though he could never bring it to any effect) and tho≈øe of <hi>his Succe≈ø≈øors,</hi> who were herein concerned, were well advi≈øed in the Policy of the De≈øign: For what could be more for the advantage of that exorbitant Power at which they aimed, than to give this
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:44425:70"/> diver≈øion to tho≈øe neighbouring Princes, which they had rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øon to fear would ≈øtand in their way? Though neither could they do that ≈øo effectually, as not at the ≈øame to be nece≈ø≈øitated to Wars at Home: what with other <hi>Antipopes</hi> (as they were ≈øet up ≈øometimes by the <hi>Emperor,</hi> ≈øometimes be <hi>Faction</hi> among them≈øelves, ≈øometimes by <hi>other Princes)</hi> what with the <hi>Emperor,</hi> and tho≈øe <hi>other Princes</hi> which abetted the <hi>Faction,</hi> or for other rea≈øons were at Enmity with the <hi>Pope,</hi> nothing but <hi>Blood</hi> was the effect of this <hi>Vial;</hi> Blood, like <hi>that of a dead Man,</hi> and every <hi>living Soul</hi> died in the Sea: <hi>i. e.</hi> Not every <hi>individual Per≈øon</hi> but ≈øome of all <hi>≈øorts, and in all places, throughout the whole Sea,</hi> in the Sen≈øe we have above given of it, <hi>peri≈øhed in the≈øe Slaughters;</hi> ≈øo <hi>univer≈øal</hi> as well as <hi>fatal</hi> was this <hi>Plague</hi> to tho≈øe who had <hi>the mark of the Bea≈øt, and wor≈øhipped his Image.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And herein we place the Bu≈øine≈øs of the <hi>≈øecond Vial,</hi> in di≈øtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction from what the <hi>third</hi> holds forth to us, which being to be poured out upon the <hi>Rivers and Fountains of Waters,</hi> as the other was <hi>upon the Sea,</hi> ≈øeems to denote <hi>that Vial</hi> to be of the <hi>≈øame nature</hi> with the former, but <hi>more restrained as to its extent, and the quality</hi> of tho≈øe, who are to be the Subjects of it.</p>

               <p>Now what can better ≈øuit this Prediction, than what happen'd in the <hi>later Cru≈øadoes,</hi> or <hi>Expeditions</hi> to the <hi>Holy Land,</hi> which were not <hi>≈øo general</hi> as the <hi>fir≈øt,</hi> and wherein only <hi>≈øome particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Princes</hi> were concern'd?</p>

               </p>
               <p>But there's another circum≈øtance that mu≈øt not be pa≈øt by, and that is, As <hi>this Vial</hi> is ≈øaid to <hi>be poured out</hi> particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly <hi>on the Fountains of Waters,</hi> by which, as is above offered, are to be under≈øtood <hi>Princes;</hi> and how it affected them, will not be doubted, if be≈øides the lo≈øs they ≈øu≈øtain'd in the ≈ølaughter of their Subjects, we ≈øhall con≈øider what in the

               <p>And if ≈øo, then the <hi>Vial</hi> poured upon <hi>the Sun, and Power thereby given him to ≈øcorch Men with Fire,</hi> will be very well interpreted by the continuance of that high <hi>U≈øurpation and Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranny,</hi> over the ≈øecular <hi>Powers, and their Subjects,</hi> (for ≈øo <hi>Men</hi> may not unfitly be con≈øtrued;) but then <hi>the≈øe U≈øurpations and Tyranny</hi> being expre≈øt by <hi>≈øcorching with Fire,</hi> will direct to ≈øomething that will an≈øwer that Allu≈øion: and nothing cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly

               <p>Now then, if <hi>Babylon</hi> hath never yet been <hi>≈øo fully de≈øtroyed,</hi> as is here expre≈øt, as he, who reads the≈øe two whole Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, will ≈øee: If <hi>I≈ørael</hi> hath never yet been <hi>≈øo re≈øtored</hi> as is there <hi>Prophe≈øied,</hi> it will follow, that what is there promi≈øed is ≈øtill to be made good to the <hi>Jews,</hi> and that which is to lead to it, will be (whether in a <hi>literal,</hi> or <hi>Metaphorical Sen≈øe,</hi> or <hi>both,</hi> I leave it to the con≈øidering Reader to determine) <hi>by the drying up the River</hi> Euphrates, and that for the de≈øtruction of <hi>Babylon</hi> in its large≈øt Extent: Whatever <hi>Babylon</hi> it is, that hath <hi>tyrannized over God's People,</hi> it is to have its <hi>Share in this Vial.</hi>

               <p>'Tis true, I ≈øubmit it, that the <hi>Holy Gho≈øt</hi> hath expre≈øly mentioned the <hi>Medes</hi> in the Judgement to be brought on <hi>Baby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lon,</hi> de≈øcribed in the≈øe two Chapters of <hi>Jeremiah,</hi> Jer. 51. 28.

               <p>The Dragon in this <hi>Book of the Revelation</hi> is taken either for that <hi>old Serpent called</hi> the <hi>Devil,</hi> or <hi>Satan,</hi> Rev. 12. 9.

The ≈øame that is expre≈øly ≈øaid of the Dragon, <hi>chap.</hi> 12, 13. The other to ri≈øe <hi>only with two Horns</hi> like a Lamb; <hi>to the fir≈øt,</hi> the Dragon is ≈øaid to have given <hi>his Power, and Seat, and great Authority;</hi> of the other 'tis ≈øaid, <hi>He ≈øpake as the Dragon,</hi> both under ≈øome <hi>relation</hi> to him, but ≈øo that the fir≈øt (as I ≈øhall offer the Rea≈øon for it pre≈øently) hath <hi>his Name</hi> here given him of <hi>the Dragon,</hi> the <hi>other</hi> that of <hi>the Bea≈øt,</hi> and the <hi>Subject</hi> of their Power is <hi>Antichri≈øtian Rome</hi> in its large≈øt Extent, <hi>bloody and cruel</hi> as <hi>a Dragon.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>For that ≈øeems to be the rea≈øon, why <hi>Rev.</hi> 12. 3. He is called <hi>Red,</hi> as if <hi>dyed with the Blood of the Saints.

               </p>
               <pb n="121" facs="tcp:44425:84"/>
               <p>It was the ruin of Chri≈øtianity he laboured for, in its very <hi>Birth,</hi> as is de≈øcribed <hi>Rev.</hi> 13. 1, 2, 3, 4. and hath not been wanting ever ≈øince to attempt <hi>upon it,</hi> in all the Methods and Degrees of that <hi>native Cruelty</hi> which is a≈øcribed <hi>to the Dra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gon.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But then the <hi>difference</hi> is, that whereas <hi>the Bea≈øt,</hi> as appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cable both <hi>to Imperial, and Papal Rome,</hi> is ≈øaid to have <hi>ten Horns,</hi> and <hi>upon his Horns ten Crowns,</hi> Rev. 13. 1. The <hi>Dra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gon</hi> is ≈øaid to have but <hi>≈øeven Crowns, and tho≈øe on his ≈øeven Heads.</hi> The Rea≈øon whereof I take to be this; That the <hi>Power of the Dragon</hi> looks backward and forward, <hi>viz.</hi> to the whole duration of <hi>the Roman</hi> Power, under its <hi>≈øeven Heads,</hi> or <hi>≈øeven forms of Government, viz.</hi> Under <hi>Kings, Con≈øuls, Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bunes, Decemvirs, Dictators, Emperors, Popes:</hi> That <hi>of the Bea≈øt</hi> is limited to the time of the <hi>ten Kings,</hi> which were af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards to ri≈øe up upon the <hi>divi≈øion</hi> of the Empire; at which time that <hi>other Bea≈øt,</hi> (for ≈øo the Holy-Gho≈øt ≈øpeaks di≈øtinctly <hi>of them</hi> in that forementioned Chapter, <hi>viz. Rev.</hi> 13. 1≈øt and 11 Ver≈øes) <hi>was to ri≈øe,</hi> and that too to hold of the <hi>Dragon;</hi> for if it be ≈øaid of <hi>the fir≈øt</hi> of <hi>the≈øe Bea≈øts,</hi> that the Dragon gave him <hi>his Power, and his Seat, and great Authority,</hi> ver≈øe 2. (as we ju≈øt now ob≈øerved) 'tis ≈øaid of the <hi>other</hi> Bea≈øt, that he ≈øpake <hi>as the Dragon.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But that the name of <hi>Dragon,</hi> (for ≈øo I ≈øuppo≈øe it to be in this Vial) is here given to the <hi>one</hi> and not to the <hi>other,</hi> I am apt to think may be, from the different Grounds on which they act; the <hi>former Bea≈øt,</hi> i. e. The Emperor ≈øtanding upon the <hi>≈øame Foundation,</hi> and exerci≈øing the ≈øame <hi>≈øort of Power,</hi> that the <hi>former Emperors,</hi> or whatever other <hi>his Predece≈ø≈øors did,</hi> i. e. what is properly <hi>Civil:</hi> The <hi>other</hi> Bea≈øt pretending his title <hi>from Religion,</hi> the title he holds under <hi>Chri≈øt,</hi> as his <hi>immediate Vicar on Earth,</hi> ≈øaid therefore to have <hi>two Horns, like a Lamb:</hi> And therefore where they come to be di≈øtinctly ≈øpoken of, (as I pre≈øume them to be <hi>in this Vial)</hi> the Name <hi>of Dragon,</hi> the <hi>common</hi> Emblem of the whole <hi>Roman Power</hi> is given <hi>to the one,</hi> that of <hi>Bea≈øt,</hi> (for the <hi>Dragon</hi> he cannot be, properly ≈øpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, becau≈øe at the mo≈øt he is but one of <hi>his ≈øeven Heads,</hi> a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

                  <hi>other Heads</hi> received their <hi>Power,)</hi> to the <hi>Other.</hi> The <hi>fir≈øt</hi> is the <hi>Bea≈øt too,</hi> ver. 1. But the Bea≈øt that was to be, <hi>as it were wounded to Death,</hi> and ever after not <hi>to live</hi> but <hi>in that</hi> Image this <hi>other Bea≈øt</hi> ≈øhould give him, <hi>ver.</hi> 15. And therefore more eminently may <hi>this Bea≈øt</hi> which gave the other <hi>that Life</hi> it hath, be ≈øtiled <hi>the Bea≈øt,</hi> as 'tis in the following part of this whole Book of the Revelation. <hi>Di≈øtinct</hi> indeed they are in all their Actings, and therefore may very well be di≈øtinctly ≈øpoken of; the <hi>fir≈øt Bea≈øt,</hi> i. e. The <hi>Emperor</hi> in the Exerci≈øe of Civil Power, as he now enjoins it, for his di≈øtingui≈øhing Character be very well remitted to what the <hi>Holy-Gho≈øt</hi> makes the <hi>common Stile</hi> of all the <hi>≈øeven Heads,</hi> or <hi>forms</hi> of Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in the whole time of the <hi>Roman Power,</hi> i. e. The ≈øtile of <hi>Dragon;</hi> the <hi>other Beast,</hi> i. e. the <hi>Pope,</hi> for his U≈øurpations over the <hi>Civil Powers,</hi> with that <hi>Juri≈ødiction</hi> he exerci≈øes over them, as well as others, and that <hi>dependance</hi> they have on him, <hi>more eminently and ≈øolitarily</hi> be ≈øaid to be <hi>the Bea≈øt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>So then by this time it will not be difficult to apprehend, whom we are to under≈øtand by the <hi>Dragon and the Bea≈øt:</hi> Not ≈øo much the <hi>Old Serpent,</hi> the <hi>Devil,</hi> or <hi>Satan him≈øelf,</hi> as <hi>tho≈øe</hi> who act <hi>under him.</hi> The <hi>one</hi> the more directly under the Relation of <hi>a Dragon,</hi> as to him he, (the Dragon) ≈øo expre≈øly is ≈øaid to <hi>give his Power; the other</hi> under the ≈øtile <hi>of Bea≈øt,</hi> as it is more particularly a≈øcribed to him, that came <hi>up out of the Earth,</hi> i. e. As is before ≈øhewed at large, as he was to u≈øurp upon the <hi>former,</hi> and come up upon the <hi>Ruins of the Empire;</hi> And this <hi>as a Lamb,</hi> though in the Event he ≈øhould ≈øhew him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øelf to act as <hi>a Dragon.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Which being granted, the only difficulty will be, whom we are to under≈øtand by <hi>the fal≈øe Prophet:</hi> Whether the <hi>delu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding Spirit,</hi> by which the≈øe Acted, tho≈øe <hi>fal≈øe Teachers, and Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducers,</hi> which act <hi>with,</hi> or <hi>under them;</hi> or ≈øome other <hi>Per≈øon,</hi> or <hi>≈øtate</hi> of Men di≈øtinct <hi>from both?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And for my part, I am inclined to think it mu≈øt be ≈øome third <hi>Per≈øon or State</hi> di≈øtinct from the <hi>two other:</hi> For I cannot be of their Opinion, who make the <hi>Dragon, and Bea≈øt,</hi> and <hi>fal≈øe Prophet</hi> to be <hi>the ≈øame,</hi> no more than I can the <hi>three un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clean Spirits</hi> which <hi>come out of their Mouths</hi> to be <hi>one;</hi> which being in it ≈øelf a <hi>Contradiction,</hi> I hope it will not be account<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed <hi>one</hi> to di≈øtingui≈øh <hi>them.</hi>

               <p>But who then ≈øhall be this <hi>fal≈øe Prophet?</hi> Who indeed, but he, who hath fal≈øly arrogated it to him≈øelf? <hi>Mahomet</hi> I mean, who is known to have a≈ø≈øumed it, and it is always given him <hi>by his Followers,</hi> and that in <hi>preference</hi> to <hi>Chri≈øt</hi> him≈øelf, the <hi>great Prophet</hi> of his Church, and he who was promi≈øed under <hi>that Name, Deuter.</hi> 18. 18.</p>
               <p>Be≈øides it is a Stile the <hi>Dragon, and Bea≈øt, Emperor and Pope,</hi> let me now call them, never a≈ø≈øumed: And I cannot ≈øee, why this ≈øhould not be admitted here; if we ob≈øerve either, where the <hi>Vial</hi> is ≈øaid to be poured out, <hi>viz. on Euphrates,</hi> in which the <hi>Turks</hi> or <hi>Mahometans</hi> are ≈øo much concerned, (as is at large ≈øhewed in this Chapter,) and what the work a≈ø≈øigned to the three <hi>unclean Spirits,</hi> is, <hi>viz.

               <p>
                  <hi>Frogs,</hi> we know, are <hi>amphibious Creatures,</hi> that delight in <hi>Filth</hi> and <hi>Slime;</hi> and <hi>Naturali≈øts</hi> tell us that many times they are immediately engendred <hi>out of the≈øe,</hi> without the help of any other Parent; but where their <hi>cleanlie≈øt Production</hi> is, 'tis by <hi>≈øpawn</hi> ca≈øt on the ≈øides of the mo≈øt <hi>miry and offen≈øive Waters:</hi> Their <hi>nature</hi> is <hi>exceedingly to increa≈øe and multiply;</hi> they love to be creeping abroad in the <hi>dark,</hi> and then <hi>croak</hi> mo≈øt.

               <p>And that <hi>the≈øe ≈øyncronize,</hi> i. e. fall in together, and are to be fulfilled at the ≈øame time, will not <hi>the manner</hi> in which they are expre≈øt, farther in≈øtruct us? Thus if in <hi>this Vial</hi> it is ≈øaid, <hi>There came a great Voice out of the Temple of Heaven, from the Throne;</hi> it is ≈øaid in <hi>the other, the Temple of God was opened in Heaven, and there was ≈øeen in his Temple, the Ark of his Covenant,</hi>

So that it is the ≈øame thing <hi>they</hi> in the main aim at; the chief difference there ≈øeems to be, is, that in the one it is ≈øaid the <hi>Temple of God was opened in Heaven,</hi> which in the other is expre≈øt only by a great Voice coming thence, without re≈øtraining its opening to the time of the Vial; but then is not that ≈øupplied by what weread, <hi>Rev.</hi> 15. 8. where 'tis ≈øaid, <hi>And the Temple was filled with Smoak from the Glory of God, and from his Power, and no Man was able to enter into the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, till the ≈øeven Plagues of the ≈øeven Angels were fulfilled:</hi> If none were able to enter in till then, then certainly it was not open till then: <hi>i. e.</hi> Opened it was in neither in the Sen≈øe I give of it, as relating to the <hi>free publication of the Go≈øpel,</hi> i. e. The <hi>Word of</hi> God, or <hi>his Te≈øtament</hi> which in the times of Antichri≈øt was lockt up, but now to <hi>be ≈øeen, and peru≈øed</hi> of all.</p>
               <p>And to <hi>this Opening of the Temple,</hi> ≈øeems to agree, what we have <hi>Rev.</hi> 11. 1. Where St. <hi>Iohn</hi> is bid <hi>to ri≈øe and mea≈øure the Temple of God, but to leave out the Court which is without the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, and mea≈øure it not, for it is given unto the</hi> Gentiles, <hi>who ≈øhould tread down the holy City for forty two Months.</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>Mea≈øuring</hi> is the ≈øetting certain bounds to any thing, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly what <hi>Iohn</hi> is bid to do, may be under≈øtood of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite, and certain Bounds ≈øet to the <hi>Church in its Purity,</hi> ≈øo that it was not to appear as <hi>≈øuch</hi> again, till the Interval that was to Intervene, ≈øhould expire, <hi>viz. the</hi> 42 <hi>Months</hi> there ≈øpoken of; that being expired, the Limits and Boundaries ≈øo ≈øet, are again removed, <hi>i. e.

               <p>And its being poured into the <hi>Air,</hi> methinks very plainly ≈øpeaks this to us, for what is the <hi>Air,</hi> but the <hi>whole Medium, or Vehicle of Light,</hi> and ≈øo may denote all who are capable of being enlightned by the Truth, to be the ≈øubjects of that clearer, or <hi>more univer≈øal Revelation,</hi> which is now to be made of it.</p>

               <p>And is it any wonder, when this ≈øhall be, <hi>that a great Earthquake ≈øhould follow:</hi> ≈øaith the Text, it ≈øhall <hi>be ≈øuch as was not ≈øince Men were upon the Earth, ≈øo mighty an Earthquake, and ≈øo great.</hi>

               <p>An <hi>Earthquake,</hi> we know <hi>≈øhakes and un≈øettles all; Hou≈øes, Villages, Towns, Cities, Hills, Valleys, Forre≈øts, whole Countries,</hi> with the <hi>Inhabitants</hi> have felt the Effects thereof: <hi>This</hi> is to

               </p>

               </p>
               <p>Which <hi>end,</hi> if the <hi>Abomination that maketh de≈øolate,</hi> be the ≈øame with <hi>Idolatry</hi> brought into the Church, in that degree, which we have ob≈øerved about the Year 455, will be about the Year 1715, to which adding for tho≈øe other two Periods mentioned by the Angel, <hi>i. e.</hi> what makes 1260, to be 1290, <hi>i. e.</hi> 30 Years; then we ≈øhall have for the Yeas there ≈øignified 1745, or what advances the ≈øaid 1260 to 1335, <hi>i. e.</hi> 75, the <hi>whole</hi> will be 1790; and as the <hi>Angel,</hi> ≈øo ≈øay I, <hi>Ble≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øed is he that waiteth, and cometh to that time,</hi> for it will be a <hi>Ble≈ø≈øed time</hi> for the Church of God, and <hi>the Glory of the Go≈øpel.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>One Remark more I have to add to this, before I leave it, that the ≈øeveral Periods we have been mentioning, for the ending the Reign of <hi>Antichri≈øt</hi> fall in likewi≈øe with what we read, <hi>Dan.</hi> 8. 14. 'Tis the An≈øwer is there given to the Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtion put by one Angel to another, asking, <hi>How long ≈øhall be the Vi≈øion concerning the Daily Sacrifice, and the tran≈øgre≈ø≈øion of De≈øolation, to give both the Sanctuary, and the Ho≈øt to be trodden down;</hi> but returned to <hi>Daniel</hi> in the≈øe Words, <hi>And he ≈øaid un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to me, Unto two Thou≈øand, and three Hundred Days, then ≈øhall the Sanctuary be clean≈øed.</hi> For con≈øider the time when this was ≈øaid to <hi>Daniel, viz.</hi> Before <hi>Chri≈øt</hi> 555; now, if we add to 555 before <hi>Chri≈øt,</hi> the number we ju≈øt now a≈ø≈øigned of 1745, the≈øe put together make up the forementioned 2300 years, the time there a≈ø≈øigned; out of which again take 30, which is the number added to the ≈øo often mentioned 1260, and we have left 1715. Which in all likelihood, if we rightly compute, I mean if Chronology be herein exact, is the fixed time for the <hi>final Ruin of Antichri≈øt,</hi> or <hi>fall of Babylon;</hi> the great Enquiry we would ≈øo fain be ≈øatisfied in.</p>
               <p>But becau≈øe ≈øtill there will ari≈øe a difficulty upon either the <hi>different Computations</hi> that men u≈øe, or <hi>the Supernumerary days</hi> that are found in our <hi>ordinary years,</hi> beyond tho≈øe the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture ≈øeems to make u≈øe of; it may not be unu≈øeful to con≈øider how many years will be abated from this time, if we take out the odd days which there are in every year; which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing five, and <hi>≈øome hours,</hi> if the≈øe be taken away from each year, (for ≈øo they mu≈øt to make it ju≈øt 360 days, which ≈øeems to
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:44425:99"/> be the Scripture-year) they make 17 <hi>years and a half,</hi> in the ≈øame proportion that 360 days make one year; which 17 years and a half, with the odd hours and minutes likewi≈øe, which are found in the ordinary year, taken out of the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øaid 1715, leaves it, as the la≈øt number to be enquired into, as a full an≈øwer to this great Que≈øtion, to be about the latter end of 1696.</p>
               <p>But in this 'twill be hard to require ≈øuch an exactne≈øs, as may not admit <hi>of a Latitude,</hi> e≈øpecially in a matter wherein <hi>Chri≈øt</hi> hath declared <hi>he will come as a Thief;</hi> wherein too the <hi>Holy Ghost</hi> him≈øelf hath ≈øpoken <hi>with that variety,</hi> as to lay down three ≈øeveral periods, <hi>viz.</hi> of 1260, 1290, and 1335, as we ju≈øt now ob≈øerv'd out of <hi>Daniel,</hi> and all in an≈øwer to the ≈øame que≈øtion; the rea≈øon whereof may be either becau≈øe 1.

            <p>1260 Days or Years are a≈ø≈øigned for the <hi>Reign of Antichrist,</hi> which beginning at 455 after Chri≈øt, the time upon ≈øo many ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counts fixed for it, as is at large there di≈øcour≈øed, gives us 1715; and the odd Days, Hours and Minutes in 1260 (for that is the number from whence the abatement mu≈øt be made, it being only of that Period the Holy-Gho≈øt ≈øo often ≈øpeaks under the different Mea≈øures) give us in the whole 18 years, and 125 days, 9 hours; <hi>i. e.</hi> five days to be taken from every year, will in in 1260 years give us 17 years and an half; and 5 hours taken like manner out of the ≈øaid 1260, will make 262 days, 12 hours; and then for the 49 minutes to be al≈øo thus taken out, tho≈øe in 1260 years, amount to 42 days, and 21 hours: For 49 minutes multiplied by 1260, give for the whole number of Minutes 61740; which divided by 60 for hours, give 1029 hours, and that again by 24 for days, gives 42 days, 21 hours.

            <p>Not that for the Rea≈øons there mentioned, and tho≈øe <hi>p.</hi> 146.
