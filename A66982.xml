         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>TO THE KING OF ENGLAND, And all Crowned Heads, and Soveraign Princes whatever.</head>
            <p>IT is the Advice of the <hi>Royal Prophet</hi> to <hi>you</hi> his <hi>Royal Brethren,</hi> Pſal. 2. 10, 11, 12. <hi>Be Wiſe now therefore O ye Kings, be instructed ye Judges of the Earth: Serve the Lord with Fear, and rejoice with Trembling: Kiſs the Son leſt he be angry, and ye pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh from the way when his Wrath is kindled but a little, Bleſſed are all they that put their truſt in him.</hi> And the reaſon of it was, beeauſe <hi>he that ſitteth in the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens,</hi> who is ſo much <hi>Superiour</hi> to the <hi>higheſt</hi> of them all, had ſet <hi>his King upon his holy Hill of Zion,</hi> ver. 6. and as the reſult of his Eternal <hi>Decree,</hi> had bid him <hi>ask of him, and he would give him the Heathen for his Inheritance, and the uttermoſt parts of the Earth for his Poſſeſſion,</hi> ver. 7, 8, and as the Effect of that his <hi>Roy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alty, he ſhould break them with a Rod of Iron, and daſh them in pieces like a Potters Veſſel.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now the time ſeems to draw on, when this is to befully accompliſh'd; and is it not the duty of the <hi>Watchman</hi> to
<pb facs="tcp:44425:3"/> give the warning before it is too late? For what will it advantage to be told of Danger, when it will not be in your Power to prevent it? To be minded of the Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach of <hi>Chriſt's Kingdom,</hi> when <hi>his Iron Rod</hi> ſhall be ſhaking over you, and <hi>your Power, your Intereſts, your Alliances, your Glory, your Wealth, and Kingdoms</hi> all daſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>in pieces</hi> againſt one another? For if you chance to be of thoſe, who give <hi>your Power to the Beaſt,</hi> this will unavoidably be <hi>your Fate,</hi> both <hi>yours and Babylon's in one Hour to</hi> come to Confuſion, <hi>Rev.</hi> 18. 10.</p>
            <p>For the preventing whereof, this following Treatiſe is here with all humility preſented; and may it among thoſe many <hi>Voices and Trumpets</hi> which have of late ſounded to the World, have that good effect to <hi>awaken your moſt Serene Majeſties,</hi> to what alone is <hi>your true intereſt of State,</hi> and that is, to <hi>hate the Whore,</hi> and <hi>make her deſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late and naked,</hi> Rev. 17. 16. for otherwiſe there can be nothing better expected, than to <hi>partake of her Plagues,</hi> Rev. 18. 4.</p>
            <p>Would <hi>you (Soveraign Princes)</hi> as it befel <hi>Nebuchad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nezzar,</hi> your <hi>Golden Head,</hi> as he is called, <hi>Dan.</hi> 2. 38. be contented, it ſhould be <hi>be ſaid to you,</hi> the <hi>Kingdom is departed from you, and they ſhall drive you from amongſt Men?</hi> Dan. 4. 31, 32.</p>
            <p>Would you be contented to ſee <hi>the Hand put forth before you,</hi> and <hi>MENE MENE, TEKEL</hi> writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten on the <hi>Walls of all your Palaces,</hi> as it was to <hi>Bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhazzar, when he lifted up himſelf againſt the Lord of Heaven,</hi> Dan. 5. 23? <hi>&amp;c.</hi> If not, then vouchſafe to take <hi>the Warning,</hi> and ſubmit in time to <hi>that Kingdom,</hi> which, it is ſaid, <hi>the God of Heaven ſhould ſet up in their Days,</hi> and in the days of thoſe <hi>other Monarchies</hi> which were to ſucceed in the World, <hi>Dan.</hi> 2. 44. For it was not for nothing, that ſo much <hi>Scorn and Contempt</hi> was
<pb facs="tcp:44425:3"/> thrown upon thoſe <hi>mighty Monarchs; Monarchs,</hi> who were ſo <hi>indeed;</hi> for they wanted no <hi>Allies,</hi> or <hi>Confe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derates</hi> to ſupport them; for they were <hi>Kings of Kings,</hi> Dan. 2. 37. and all <hi>People, Nations, and Languages trembled and feared before them, whom they would they ſlew, and whom they would they kept alive; and whom they would they ſet up, and whom they would they put down,</hi> Dan. 5. 19. Believe it <hi>(great Sirs)</hi> it was not for nothing that ſuch <hi>memorable Examples</hi> were ſet forth, <hi>it was for your Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monition, upon whom the Ends of the World are come;</hi> as it is 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10, 11. 'Twas that <hi>after Ages</hi> might grow Wife, as knowing there is <hi>no reſiſting</hi> that <hi>Soveraign,</hi> who is <hi>higher than the higheſt; no withstanding that Power</hi> which can ſo eaſily <hi>break in pieces,</hi> and conſume <hi>all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Kingdoms, but it ſelf ſhall ſtand for Ever,</hi> Dan. 2. 44.</p>
            <p>It hath in Effect done all this already, the <hi>Babyloni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an,</hi> the <hi>Perſian, the Greek Monarchies</hi> have already been utterly deſtroyed by it, and the <hi>Roman</hi> ſo far, as to ſtand upon its laſt Legs, (or rather to expreſs it in the words of <hi>the Viſion, Dan.</hi> 2. 33.) <hi>to have both its Legs and Feet ſo broken,</hi> as to ſtand only on <hi>ſome of its Toes;</hi> Some of thoſe <hi>ten Kings</hi> I mean, which after the <hi>taking of Rome, became the parts and ſupport of that Empire.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And as <hi>Daniel</hi> ſaid to <hi>Nebuchadnezzar, Thou art this Head of Gold,</hi> Dan. 2. 38. So to <hi>you, O Kings,</hi> may it be ſaid, <hi>you</hi> are <hi>thoſe Toes;</hi> it is on <hi>you</hi> ſubſiſts, what is ſtill behind, of <hi>the laſt Monarchy,</hi> as it hath been divided into <hi>ſeveral Kingdoms;</hi> and of how great con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern muſt it be to <hi>you</hi> to be rightly informed how you may <hi>perpetuate your Royalty,</hi> and ſo eſtabliſh <hi>your Thrones,</hi> that you may not be of thoſe, whom the <hi>Stone cut</hi> out without Hands, <hi>ſhall ſmite and break in pieces,</hi> Dan. 2. 34?</p>
            <pb facs="tcp:44425:4"/>
            <p>Think let Men, what they will, of the <hi>outward Weakneſs of Chriſts Kingdom,</hi> of the <hi>little Aſſiſtance</hi> it hath, or is like to meet with in the World; let there be no <hi>Hand</hi> ſeen to <hi>cut</hi> out this Stone, no humane <hi>Strength or Policy,</hi> that is ready to contribute toward the <hi>forming of it,</hi> yet it will grow into a <hi>great Mountain, and fill the whole Earth,</hi> ver. 34, 35. <hi>The Gold, the Silver, the Braſs, the Iron, and Cley</hi> muſt <hi>all</hi> give place <hi>to it;</hi> it is a good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <hi>Image</hi> indeed, which theſe make in <hi>Nebuchadnezzar's Viſion,</hi> but it is but <hi>an Image,</hi> and muſt vaniſh before <hi>this Stone,</hi> as the <hi>Dream,</hi> that firſt prefented it.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Be Wife now therefore,</hi> let me again repeat it, <hi>O ye Kings; be inſtructed ye Judges of the Earth;</hi> let nothing draw you from what is your <hi>true Intereſt,</hi> let none of the <hi>Allurements,</hi> none of <hi>the Sorceries of the great Whore, of her,</hi> who hath <hi>glorified her ſelf, and lived deliciouſly, who hath ſaid in her Heart, I ſit a Queen, and am no Widdow,</hi> and <hi>ſhall ſee no Sorrow,</hi> but whoſe <hi>Plagues</hi> notwithſtanding <hi>ſhall come in one Day;</hi> let no <hi>tenderneſs for her,</hi> with whom <hi>any of you have lived deliciouſly</hi> make you pity, <hi>bewail, and lament her,</hi> leſt <hi>your Judgment too come in one Hour with hers,</hi> Rev. 18. 7, 8, 9, 10. No; <hi>ſtand as far off</hi> as you can, for fear <hi>of her Torment; haſten away, haſten away,</hi> that the <hi>Ruins of her Fall</hi> reach you not.</p>
            <p>You ſee how certainly all is foretold, you ſee how much of this is already begun; what is behind, for <hi>your Kingdoms,</hi> (and what ſhould be more dear to you than your moſt glittering Crowns,) for you Souls ſake <hi>dread,</hi> and <hi>avoid.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But who can hope to be ſo happy as to be heard on this <hi>Subject,</hi> when what is here written, like <hi>the Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion</hi> ſhe teaches, muſt be to many of you in an <hi>unknown Language,</hi> and were it worthy to ſpeak in your ſeveral

            <p>But is it <hi>I then,</hi> or <hi>the Truth,</hi> that calls upon you?

            <p>And let me, <hi>in all Humility,</hi> beſeech <hi>you</hi> once more <hi>to think, and that</hi> is <hi>on thoſe</hi> who have been uſing

            <p>It was by <hi>taking him out of the way that hindred,</hi> that <hi>Antichriſt, the Man of Sin, and Son of Perdition,</hi> i. e. By the removing the <hi>Roman Emperor,</hi> that he was firſt capable of <hi>Exalting himſelf.</hi>

            <p>Conſider how by their ſiding one while with the <hi>Ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtern,</hi> another while with the <hi>Weſtern Emperor,</hi> (after the Empire ceaſed at <hi>Rome)</hi> they made theſe to claſh againſt one another, <hi>themſelves</hi> ſtill gaining by the <hi>Rupture?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Conſider how it was in the Proſecution of this their wicked purpoſe, they called in firſt the Emperor of <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> and then <hi>Pepin</hi> againſt <hi>Aiſtulphus King of Lombardy:</hi> And what became of <hi>his Territories,</hi> and the <hi>Exarchat of Ravenna</hi> in the Iſſue, which inſtead of being reſtored to the <hi>Emperor,</hi> as was demanded by his <hi>Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſadors</hi> were decreed by <hi>Pepin</hi> to the <hi>Pope.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Conſider, they are <hi>Contemplations</hi> worthy <hi>your Royal Thoughts,</hi> what was their Deſign in beginning a <hi>new Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire</hi> in the <hi>VVeſt,</hi> and clapping <hi>the Crown</hi> by ſurprize, on the Head of <hi>Charles the Great,</hi> as it is reported to have been done whilſt he was upon his Knees at his Devotion?

            </p>
            <p>See the Tenure <hi>(Great Monarchs)</hi> they preſcribe for all your <hi>Royalties</hi> to be held by! And if, whilſt it was to ſerve <hi>them, they</hi> call you the <hi>Vicars of Chriſt;</hi> for there

            </p>
            <p>Will it not be too great an humbling <hi>to you (Mighty Princes)</hi> to ſhew you no fewer than ſeven Emperors, <hi>i. e.

            </p>
            <p>And is it any wonder that <hi>Kings</hi> and other <hi>Princes</hi> have the <hi>honour</hi> to follow their <hi>Emperors</hi> herein? <hi>Baro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius</hi> in his Annals, <hi>Anno</hi> 1162, brings in the <hi>Kings of</hi> France <hi>and</hi> England at once performing the Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice of <hi>Yeomen of his Stirrup,</hi> and leading his Horſe, <hi>one</hi> by <hi>one Rein,</hi> the <hi>other</hi> by the <hi>other,</hi> till from the <hi>place</hi> where they met <hi>Him,</hi> they had con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducted <hi>Him</hi> to the place <hi>of his Reception:</hi> And leſt <hi>full Homage</hi> ſhould not be paid <hi>to Him,</hi> he gives an account, at the ſame time, of <hi>a Prince of the Saracens, bowing the knee before him, kiſſing his feet,</hi> and this in the Name of <hi>his Maſter,</hi> the <hi>King of the Mahometans:</hi> 'twas to <hi>Alexander the third,</hi> whom <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ronius</hi> ſo much magnifies for his <hi>meekneſs, moderation, and goodneſs,</hi> Ann. 1177. that theſe Ceremonies were perform'd; in which he likewiſe joins all <hi>Orthodox Kings, and Princes,</hi> as crowding in for a part in <hi>ſo glorious a ſervice.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And the Truth is, <hi>your own Records (great Prince)</hi> will give you but <hi>too many Inſtances</hi> of <hi>that Injuſtice,</hi> that <hi>Inſolence,</hi> thoſe <hi>Indignities</hi> of all ſorts, with <hi>which</hi>

            </p>
            <p>To this I might add that <hi>great Diminution</hi> it is to you

            <p>I Return you many Thanks not only for the Honour, but the benefit of peruſing your Learned Tract, and am ſorry I muſt make ſo unſuitable a Requital, as to trouble you with my Excuſe for not Licenſing it: However, I hope when you have conſidered it, you will allow it to be reaſonable. I will not alledge, (though I might do it) that I have all along de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clined medling with Diſcourſes of this Nature, which have been offered me by thoſe, I had great reaſon to eſteem. But the Truth in ſhort is, that a large Book on this Subject, and a very accurate one, as I am told, was lately, not for the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance, but the Matters ſake, ſent back from hence without an Imprimatur. I believe you have hinted the reaſon out of St. <hi>Chryſoſtome,</hi> where he ſays that St. <hi>Paul</hi> would not plainly ſay, what the <gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF" extent="1 span">

            <head>THE PREFACE TO THE READER.</head>
            <p>WHAT it was that hath ſo long made theſe Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>madverſions abortive, will appear by the Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter on the preceding Page; and therefore with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any farther appeal to other Witneſſes, to ſhew that what is here publiſhed, is no more done to ſerve a turn now, than it was then written for it; What I have to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt from every Beader, is, that it may be received with the ſame Sincerity with which it was firſt Penned; which was in the retirement of a long Sickneſs, when I was ſequeſtred from my family, (the beſt part of it being upon other oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſions abſent from me,) and had only <hi>God,</hi> and <hi>his good Spirit,</hi> and <hi>my own Conſcience</hi> to confer with; <hi>that Conſcience,</hi> which notwithſtanding the Prejudice with which ſome then, and ſince have loaded me, as if I <hi>had been leſs ſound in our Holy Reformed Religion,</hi> ſuffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red me not then to temporize with thoſe who ſate at the Helm, (to the greateſt of whom, I could have had as eaſy acceſs, as any others of my Brethren,) that <hi>Conſcience</hi> I ſay, which ſuffered me not then to temporize, and I thank my God, makes me ſtill above all <hi>ſordid Flattery;</hi> and I deſire to bleſs his Holy Name, (I hope what I ſhall here publiſh will be the freer from all <hi>carnal Intereſt,)</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:44425:16"/> who hath in his Providence made me in ſome degree <hi>a Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyr,</hi> both <hi>then,</hi> and <hi>now.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>For if I have ſince ſuffered, as I am ſenſible I have, for being thought to be one whom my Great <hi>Maſter then</hi> favoured, I ſuffered no leſs then, for being thought what I was, and ſhall always endeavour to acquit my ſelf therein, one <hi>of the moſt firm and unſhaken Proteſtants:</hi> No, I am bold to ſay, whatever other Opinion <hi>that great Prince</hi> had of me, he never thought otherwiſe of me, than as one (let it be called <hi>Stiffneſs, Moroſeneſs, Pride,</hi> or what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever other name <hi>ill Men</hi> have for thoſe, who turn not with every Wind, I am little ſollicitous) who knew neither how <hi>to diſſemble or fawn.</hi> But whatever either then, or ſince hath befallen me, I have this to comfort my ſelf with, that nothing hath, nor I hope ever ſhall alienate my <hi>Zeal</hi> from <hi>that Truth,</hi> for which I have deſired always to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear: I have done it at <hi>Court,</hi> in the <hi>Univerſity, City,</hi> and where-ever elſe it lay in my <hi>way.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And if I had nothing elſe to plead for my Sincerity, I think the Dedication of that Sermon to his Majeſty, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented to him on that <hi>very Day, and at the very point</hi> of time, when the <hi>Zealous Bigots</hi> of the other Religion were hurrying him to his firſt publick appearance at their Worſhip, the Dedication I ſay of that Sermon alone, in which the <hi>Superſtitions of Rome,</hi> and the <hi>Impieties of the Jeſuits,</hi> (who were then the prevailing Faction) are ſo highly declared againſt, might be alledged for a ſufficient proof; I am ſure it was what was moſt heinouſly reſented by <hi>the Party,</hi> and the <hi>Author,</hi> (as appears by what was afterwards publiſhed againſt him, in a Pamphlet of theirs, called <hi>Good advice to the Pulpits,</hi> p. 61.) had the Honour to be fonnd in that <hi>good Company,</hi> to whieh none I think will deny the ſtile of the <hi>Beſt of Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtants.</hi> But if the Cry be once raiſed, what's miſtaken <hi>at</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:44425:16"/> 
               <hi>Court,</hi> ſhall be doubly ſo in the <hi>City,</hi> and from thence ſoon ecchoed into <hi>the Country,</hi> and the moſt <hi>innocent Perſon</hi> forthwith made the <hi>mark of popular Outrage;</hi> for it is but dreſſing up the Martyr in <hi>Beaſts Skins,</hi> and every dog will be ſnarling and barking at him: nay, even thoſe, who in their <hi>great Underſtanding</hi> know not what it is to be <hi>Papiſt, or Proteſtant,</hi> nay, would it may be, be hard put to it, if they were to prove in what it is them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves are <hi>diſtinguiſhed even from Brutes,</hi> ſhall however in their <hi>great Zeal</hi> run away with the <hi>Cry,</hi> as if they were the only <hi>Skilled Profeſſors in Divinity,</hi> and Men who have ſpent all their time in hard Study, and made it their Buſineſs to live up to <hi>that Divinity</hi> they profeſs, ſhall not be thought worthy to offer Senſe or Reaſon to ſuch <hi>migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty Sophies.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And if after all, they chance to find their Error, what is the Amends is to be made for all, beyond this? That the <hi>Perſon</hi> they <hi>thus run on, is the moſt miſtaken Man in the World!</hi> But who bid them thus miſtake, who bid them firſt take up an Error, and then uſe all the <hi>rudeneſs untaught nature is guilty of,</hi> to defend it?</p>
            <p>But what muſt a Man ſay then, to remove ſuch a Scandal? Will it avail to ſay I Sucked in the greateſt deteſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation of Popery with my Mothers milk, that ever ſince I was able to uſe my Tongue, I forbore not to do it in the abhorrence of its Superſtitions, and Idolatries? Will, if nothing elſe, this <hi>following Treatiſe</hi> ſay any thing for its Author in this matter? VVhat ſhall I take <hi>(O Poſterity judge thou of this depraved</hi> Age, wherein ſuch Apologies are needful!) to teſtifie the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dignation I cannot but have to be thus Traduced? A fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourer of Popery! Do I believe a <hi>Hell,</hi> a <hi>Devil?</hi> Let Popery and theſe be loved at once! No, be it not <hi>my Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption, O my God, but thy Grace</hi> that draws the
<pb facs="tcp:44425:17"/> Profeſſion from me) may I, if ever Thou bringeſt <hi>the Wheel</hi> over thy People in this Nation, be the firſt <hi>Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs</hi> in this <hi>thy great Cauſe.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But I am aſhamed there ſhould be occaſion for any thing of this Nature, nor ſhould I have troubled the VVorld with it, were it not, that thoſe who appear in Print, at the ſame time ſet themſelves up, <hi>as Marks to be ſhot at,</hi> e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very one ſpending his Verdict, and accepting, or rejecting the VVork, according to the reſpect he hath for the Author.</p>
            <p>But moſt eſpecially thus it happens in Subjects of this nature; for how can any one pretend to, or hope that the VVorld ſhould believe, that be entirely gives up himſelf (and yet certainly without it, there can be but little pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bability of his ſteering well in it,) to the conduct of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, if at the ſame time he hath any <hi>covert Diſſimulation,</hi> not to ſay <hi>Coldneſs</hi> in the Argument, whereof he treats?</p>
            <p>Can a <hi>Papiſt in Maſquerade</hi> (ſucceding Ages will won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der at the Stile) decry <hi>Popery, diſcover</hi> all the <hi>abomina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of it,</hi> fix <hi>the Judgment</hi> declared againſt it, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſatisfied that <hi>the ſeven laſt Plagues</hi> are but ſo many de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees of that Ruin, which is foretold to belong to the <hi>Beaſt?</hi> Theſe I think are Incongruities, that no <hi>wiſe,</hi> no <hi>good</hi> Man can imagine to be conſiſtent, and therefore taking for granted that all is <hi>defamation,</hi> and but the effects of downright <hi>Malice, and Ignorance;</hi> I will ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe the <hi>veil to be taken off,</hi> the <hi>Cloud vaniſhed,</hi> and my ſelf to be a much <hi>better Proteſtant</hi> than thoſe, who out of deſign, or from the want <hi>of being better informed,</hi> have <hi>raiſed, or entertained</hi> the Scandal.</p>
            <p>It may not be altogether improper to mention to whom the <hi>Dedication</hi> was firſt intended, and that was to my gracious <hi>Maſter, King James the Second,</hi> (whoſe <hi>late Royal Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours</hi> towards me poſſibly might be one Reaſon, why that Scandal I have been wiping off, was caſt upon me; but no
<pb facs="tcp:44425:17"/> time ought to blot out my grateful Senſe of what was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned, though without effect as well as without my ſeeking it,) And I hope it may ſtill find that good effect <hi>with him,</hi> (if it hath the lot to come to his <hi>Royal Hands)</hi> which his moſt <hi>humble,</hi> and <hi>Dutiſul Servant</hi> and <hi>Subject</hi> then de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned it to; I am ſure he knows in his <hi>higheſt Proſperity,</hi> I never was of thoſe who flattered <hi>his Greatneſs,</hi> and I am ſure he hath that good Opinion of me, to believe that in <hi>his Troubles,</hi> I never can be <hi>a Shimei.</hi> And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore my Hopes are, he will in the firſt place judge me Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere in <hi>that Loyalty</hi> I owe to <hi>him</hi> who <hi>is King of Kings,</hi> and in <hi>the ſecond,</hi> I owe <hi>to thoſe</hi> who rule under <hi>him,</hi> to whom I am ſure I could never have aquitted my ſelf, had I not (which is the buſineſs of this Treatiſe) repreſented <hi>Rome</hi> in its true Colours <hi>to them;</hi> that <hi>Rome</hi> which hath ſo long uſurpt upon their <hi>Royalties,</hi> and can no longer ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt, than by the <hi>diminution of their Majeſties,</hi> they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribute to it.</p>
            <p>I now proceed to ſpeak of the <hi>Work</hi> it ſelf, the occaſion whereof is beſt ſeen by <hi>the Title Page;</hi> and whether, and how far it hath anſwered <hi>its Title will appear</hi> by that time the Reader ſhall have peruſed its Contents, in which I hope he will not think his Time altogether loſt; many <hi>of the notions</hi> he ſhall there find <hi>being wholy new,</hi> and what none elſe hitherto hath touched at, <hi>and all of them co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herent</hi> as between themſelves, ſo <hi>with the whole:</hi> And if ſometimes more than one <hi>ſingle Event</hi> be offered for the <hi>Explication, or rather Illuſtration</hi> of the <hi>reſpective Points,</hi> I think that is a <hi>liberty of Propheſying,</hi> (let me ſo expreſs it) <hi>no good, or wiſe Man</hi> will Condemn, as being but agreeable to that <hi>variety of Senſe,</hi> in which all allow <hi>the Scripture</hi> to abound: Beſides, were it only for <hi>the reſreſhing the Reader,</hi> that a <hi>Variety is ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times given,</hi> it is certainly what at leaſt might be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſed,
<pb facs="tcp:44425:18"/> that his <hi>Curioſity and Pleaſure</hi> are but hereby ſerved.</p>
            <p>And as for <hi>the Author of Nubes Teſtium, whoſe Preface</hi> chiefly occaſioned theſe Reflections, I hope he will not look upon it as an <hi>improper Anſwer to</hi> his whole Book, to ſhew how <hi>thoſe Corruptions</hi> we blame in the <hi>Romiſh Church</hi> came in; how the <hi>Romiſh Church</hi> it ſelf grew to that heighth, at which it is, or hath been in any time of the <hi>Reign of Antichriſt;</hi> for what will it avail to urge <hi>Authorities of Fathers,</hi> Men ſubject to Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors as our ſelves, for <hi>thoſe Corruptions,</hi> (were they in their teſtimony all with him) if it be proved, that thoſe points he brings them to confirm, are part <hi>of thoſe Corruptions,</hi> for which ſhe is ſo highly to be Condemned?</p>
            <p>I would do all the Right imaginable to <hi>Antiquity,</hi> but there's a great difference between what bears the title <hi>of ſuch,</hi> and what really is <hi>true Antiquity.</hi> The <hi>Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers themſelves</hi> have they not been <hi>corrupted</hi> by the crafty <hi>Forgeries of temporizing Hypocrites?</hi> Or if they had not been <hi>corrupted,</hi> is it not enough to <hi>abate their Credit,</hi> that in what the <hi>Author brings them againſt us,</hi> they either differ <hi>from themſelves</hi> in other <hi>parts of their Writings,</hi> or, what is much more, they dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer from the Holy Scripture? The Holy Scripture I ſay, which muſt be allowed to be <hi>the Judge in this Caſe.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Nor will it ſerve their Turn, what they uſually anſwer us with here, that by giving thus much <hi>to Scripture,</hi> and making <hi>every one Judge of the Senſe of it,</hi> we put all upon the Iſſue of <hi>a private Spirit:</hi> For we make no <hi>private Perſon</hi> any more a Judge here, than they do; we ſuppoſe to be able to reach the ſenſe of Scripture, all means muſt be uſed for the attaining it; only this we are ſure, whether <hi>this,</hi> or the <hi>other Perſon</hi> hit it, or no, yet it is the true ſenſe of Scripture ought to prevail beyond the
<pb facs="tcp:44425:18"/> Authority of <hi>Councils, Fathers,</hi> or any other <hi>Doctors whatever.</hi> And whatever the <hi>Perſon</hi> be, who is ſo happy as to ſhew moſt Reaſon for the <hi>Senſe</hi> he gives of it, this is <hi>He,</hi> whoſe Opinion ought to obtain.</p>
            <p>'Tis true indeed, with reſpect to any <hi>private Perſon,</hi> at the firſt View, the names of <hi>Councils, and Fathers,</hi> and the like, ſeem to carry with them a notion of what is <hi>more publick,</hi> in Oppoſition to a <hi>private Spirit;</hi> but all this is but <hi>Fallacy,</hi> and no way the Inference, that ought to be made from that which is urged in this matter, <hi>viz.</hi> That <hi>no Propheſy of the Scripture is of any private Interpretation,</hi> Pet. 2. 1. 20. For that is not the meaning of <hi>that Place,</hi> that <hi>one Perſon</hi> is <hi>more private than two,</hi> than <hi>a whole Council, than all ancient Writers</hi> whatever; but that <hi>he,</hi> and <hi>they</hi> too are <hi>Private,</hi> and their <hi>Interpretation is ſuch,</hi> if it agree not with the <hi>Analogy of Scripture,</hi> and the ſenſe of the <hi>Holy Spirit himſelf:</hi> 'Tis this Senſe, taking it without reſpect to any Perſons, makes it not <hi>to be private;</hi> and ſo the <hi>antitheſis</hi> there lies, <hi>for the Prophecy came not in old time by the Will of Man; But Holy Men of God ſpake, as they were moved by the Holy-Ghoſt.</hi> It is not the <hi>Will of Man,</hi> the <hi>Decrees of Councils, the Sentiments of Fathers,</hi> the <hi>pretended Infallibility of any Chair,</hi> (all this is but the <hi>Will of Man,)</hi> if they concur not with what the <hi>Holy-Ghoſt</hi> hath ſpoken.</p>
            <p>And as for what I differ from others in, who have given up themſelves to the ſame <hi>ſort of Studies,</hi> I hope it will not be imputed ſo much to an <hi>affected Singularity,</hi> as to the <hi>force of Truth;</hi> I having induſtriouſly avoided to conſult the <hi>Hypotheſes, or Explications of others,</hi> whilſt this was Writing, that ſo I might not be drawn to lean to any <hi>humane Authority,</hi> and ſerved my ſelf only with ſuch <hi>general Notions,</hi> as were before <hi>imprinted on my Mind,</hi> without any particular applying my ſelf to ſuch, who might
<pb facs="tcp:44425:19"/> have been apt to lead me.

            <p>I reaſoned alſo with the ſame Perſon, <hi>viz.</hi> Monſieur <hi>Deſgalleſnierres,</hi> formerly Miniſter of <hi>Mans</hi> in <hi>France,</hi> now of one of the French Churches in <hi>Weſtminſter,</hi> on ſome o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Heads, in which I found my ſelf ſo much to differ from that <hi>Excellent Perſon</hi> (his worthy Countryman <hi>Monſieur Jurieu</hi> I mean,) particularly as to the ſenſe of the firſt <hi>Vial,</hi> which he makes to conſiſt in <hi>the Corruptions</hi> that then broke forth in the <hi>Romiſh Church,</hi> whereas I am apt to think, it ought rather to be applied to the <hi>Plague</hi> that was ſent as the <hi>Puniſhment of ſuch Corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,</hi> in the Irruptions of the <hi>Saracens:</hi> As alſo in the fourth, ſixth, and ſeventh Vial, I cannot but dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer from that <hi>great Man,</hi> as may be ſeen in the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing diſcourſe; that I fall in with him in the ſecond, and third, is but agreeable to my Notion on the firſt, in which if <hi>the</hi> Saracens <hi>infeſted</hi> the <hi>men that had the mark of the Beaſt</hi> in their <hi>own Country,</hi> the <hi>men that had the mark of the Breaſt</hi> are in judgment permitted to attempt the revenging the Injury in <hi>the Country, or Territories of the</hi> Saracens, under the ſecond and third Vial. And if in the ſame time, I farther offer the <hi>great Plague</hi> that the <hi>Waldenſes,</hi> and <hi>Albigenſes</hi> at that time were to thoſe <hi>who had the mark of the Beaſt,</hi> I hope 'twill be no <hi>darkning of knowledge,</hi> to leave it to the choice of the <hi>Reader,</hi> which he thinks fitteſt to pitch on.</p>
            <p>That I have conſulted with other Authors, ſuch as the <hi>Fathers, Hiſtories, Councils,</hi> and <hi>other Writers,</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:44425:22"/> that was but neceſſary for the informing my ſelf of the <hi>State of the Romiſh Church,</hi> the <hi>Romiſh, Greek,</hi> and <hi>Mahometan Empires,</hi> with the Hiſtories of <hi>the ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Princes, and Countries in</hi> any <hi>of theſe,</hi> in order to the knowledge of thoſe great <hi>Events and Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances</hi> of all ſorts, that might conduce to the Explain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>theſe Important Truths:</hi> But that I have not every where mention'd my Authorities, was at preſent to eaſe my ſelf, and the Reader, as not knowing, but that a diſcourſe of this nature, if it ſhould happen to find acceptance in the World, might draw farther enlarge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments from me hereafter; in which it would be requiſite to be more exact as to the Quotations.</p>
            <p>There are I confeſs ſome <hi>other Diſcourſes</hi> on <hi>this Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject,</hi> which I cannot ſay I have not ſeen, though it was long after I had in effect <hi>finiſhed this Treatiſe,</hi> and as I before ſaid, I was unwilling to peruſe any thing that might <hi>Prejudice,</hi> or be <hi>a Bar</hi> to my own <hi>free Thoughts;</hi> and it is but late that they came into my Hands, and that up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the occaſion of ſome Notions communicated by me to the <hi>Learned, and my worthy Friend, Monſieur Allix,</hi> who thereupon ſpoke to me of <hi>Dr. Creſſener's, and Mr. Bever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly's</hi> Books, both of them very ingenious Men, but utterly differing in their notions from what I here preſent: As alſo he hath given me very high Expectations of what the <hi>profoundly learned Biſhop of St. Aſaph</hi> hath, <hi>or is preparing on theſe Subjects,</hi> but found me ſtill under that <hi>Stiffneſs,</hi> that believing what I have here written to <hi>be of a Piece,</hi> I was unwilling ſo much to be acquainted with what that <hi>Excellent Prelate</hi> hath to make the World happy with, when he ſhall pleaſe to make it publick. Only having as I before ſaid, received Mr. <hi>Beverly's Book,</hi> I could not but be very much pleaſed to find him, though upon different Grounds from what I go on, fix in a manner the ſame Period
<pb facs="tcp:44425:22"/> for <hi>the Ruin of Antichriſt,</hi> he fixing it in 1697, without ſaying what part of the Year it is in which he fixes it, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as my Computation makes it to be either in the later end of 1696, or the middle of 1697, for I place it in 1697, and a half after the ſubſtraction of the odd Days in the different Computations, or if the fraction <hi>of Hours be</hi> taken out about the end of 1696, no great difference of Calculation, though the Foundation on which we go be <hi>al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together different.</hi> And I cannot but adhere to my own, his notion of the <hi>Months</hi> ſpoken of in the Propheſie, <hi>being Jewiſh Months,</hi> ſeeming to be a little pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carious, and the number he ſets of 475, not being ſo pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per to the time of the <hi>ten Kings or Horns riſing up,</hi> as 455, or thereabout, on which I pitch. For though on the ſuppoſition he goes, it may well enough point to <hi>the Ceſſation of the Empire,</hi> it will not ſo well agree to the <hi>riſe of the Beaſt, and the ten Horns with it.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But I will not too much controvert the matter with that <hi>Zealous Perſon,</hi> I cannot but rejoice to ſee his <hi>Aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance</hi> that the Event will Correſpond with his Calcula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, nor can I be <hi>diſſatisfied</hi> that it falls in <hi>with mine.</hi>

               <p>WHEN I firſt entred on this Work, I had it in my thoughts to have replied both to <hi>Preface and Book,</hi> but through a very great and long Indiſpoſition in Health, I was not able to make that ſpeed I intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the Deſign, and was greatly pleaſed to find my ſelf pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented in ſeveral parts of it, by the Learned Pens of thoſe who had ſo ſucceſsfully ingaged therein: Nor did I queſtion, (what hath ſince happen'd) but that a very little time would produce a full anſwer to every thing that was material, in the whole <hi>Collection,</hi> though ſhould there not have been a Sylla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble more offered in the Controverſie, than what the Author had given me occaſion to ſpeak to from the <hi>Preface,</hi> I am apt to think, there would be little reaſon to boaſt <hi>his Monuments of Antiquity;</hi> the <hi>Gibeonitiſh Craft of old Sacks upon their Aſſes, of old and rent Wine-bottles, of old and clouted Shooes, of old Garments, and dry and mouldy Bread:</hi> Joſhua 9. 4, 5. whereby ('tis eaſie to make out the Alluſion) thoſe, for whom he writes, are ſo much concern'd to hide all their Cheats, will be but a poor proof of their coming from a far Country (let me ſo ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs the remote and diſtant Ages of the Church) unleſs they bring with them, what the <hi>Gibeonites</hi> did not, <hi>Truth and Sincerity.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>For is there not ſome Standard by which <hi>Antiquity</hi> it ſelf muſt be tryed? For however, <hi>error</hi> can never be <hi>quid primum,</hi> yet it may be <hi>quid antiquum;</hi> we know it is as ancient, as the <hi>Fall of Man:</hi> Nay, more than that, as the <hi>Fall of Lucifer:</hi> So that the pretence of <hi>Antiquity</hi> alone, were all granted which is brought for <hi>ſuch,</hi> would not be ſufficient to eſtabliſh matters in Debate, unleſs what is urged as <hi>antiquum,</hi> or what is <hi>ancient,</hi> be proved likewiſe to be <hi>primum</hi> or <hi>firſt, i. e.</hi> to be

               </p>
               <p>To begin therefore where the Author doth, <hi>viz.</hi> That <hi>Novelty in Faith is ſo great a ſcandal to any that lay claim to the Truth of Chriſtianity, that whereſoever it is effectually proved, there all pretences immediately fall to the ground, and there can be no Truth in that Society, beſide the noiſe of it, and the Name,</hi> I am very ready to grant, and ſhall only conſider, that we may come plainly to the matter in Debate, theſe two things.</p>

               <p>Can we imagine that they <hi>ever pretended,</hi> or that in Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, their atteſting ought ſhould alter the nature of what they are brought to atteſt? In the particular matter in debate, will their aſſerting it make that to be <hi>Truth,</hi> which before was <hi>Error?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Will their aſſerting that the <hi>Invocation of Saints in Heaven is profitable and convenient?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>That there's a reſpect and Veneration due to their Relicts?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Will their aſſerting that <hi>praying for the Souls departed, is ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantageous to them,</hi> and was the <hi>practice of the Primitive Church?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Will their aſſerting that <hi>in the bleſſed Sacrament</hi> is contain'd the <hi>true, real, ſubſtantial Body of Chriſt, the ſubſtance of the Bread and Wine being converted into the true ſubſtance of Chriſt's Body and Blood,</hi> make all theſe things to be <hi>ſound, and Orthodox?</hi> if in the mean time from the <hi>Letter of Scripture,</hi> and the <hi>Analogy of Faith</hi> therein contain'd, it ſhall be made to appear that moſt of theſe things are highly <hi>Superſtitious,</hi> if not Idolatrous! Or to join Iſſue on ſo much of the other heads, as can concern the points of Controverſie at preſent under Debate (if at all it doth con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern them)</p>
               <p>Will their aſſerting that <hi>Chriſt built his Church upon Peter,</hi> &amp;c. If that were to the <hi>ends they pretend,</hi> advance <hi>Him</hi> or <hi>his Succeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſors</hi> to any higher <hi>Title,</hi> or <hi>Dignity,</hi> than <hi>Chriſt himſelf</hi> gave <hi>him in his Goſpel?</hi>

               <p>Will their aſſerting that <hi>Traditions are to be received,</hi> &amp;c. though all brought under that head, no way reaches the <hi>pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent Controverſie about Traditions?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Will their aſſerting, laſtly, that the <hi>making the ſign of the Croſs,</hi> the <hi>keeping Images of Chriſt, and his Saints</hi> was the practice <hi>of the Primitive Church,</hi> be a Reaſon, either <hi>why Traditions</hi> ſhould <hi>be of equal</hi> Authority with the Scripture, or the <hi>ſign of the Croſs, or Images ſhould have Divine Honour</hi> paid to them? For otherwiſe, they come not up to what is at preſent under Debate: Though had <hi>they</hi> ſaid all this (for I am contented he make the beſt of his Argument) what is this, or whatever elſe they would have the <hi>Fathers ſpeak for them,</hi> if at the ſame time they ſpeak <hi>againſt themſelves? i. e. againſt</hi> what they have deliver'd directly <hi>contrary to it,</hi> in any other of <hi>their writings;</hi> And what is much more, <hi>againſt</hi>

                  <hi>Chriſt, i. e.</hi> either <hi>againſt the direct Rule of Scripture,</hi> or the purity of that <hi>Religion</hi> themſelves ſo Zealouſly profeſſed?</p>
               <p>This as to <hi>the firſt,</hi> viz. How far the Authority of the Fathers, ſimply conſider'd, ought to obtain in matters of Faith? and that can be no farther than they <hi>ſpeak agreeably</hi> to that <hi>Faith</hi> they are <hi>brought to atteſt;</hi> neither <hi>they,</hi> nor <hi>any men,</hi> as <hi>St. Paul</hi> gives the Rule 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11. 1. being to be any farther followed, than they are the <hi>Followers of Chriſt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Author indeed ſuggeſts other Topicks, from whence their Authority may be leſſen'd, <hi>Pref. p.</hi> 3. in theſe words: <hi>'Tis true, it cannot be denied, but many things in the Ancient Fathers are Obſcure; their Names have been prefixt to Books, of which they were never the Authors, Additions have been made to ſome of their Writings, beſides the divers miſtakes of Tranſcribers in the Publiſhing their Works:</hi> To which I might add, which alone is more than all this, that Horrible abuſe of the <hi>Indices Expur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatorii,</hi> by which ſo many Additions, Defalcations, and alte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations of all ſorts have been made in them: But this he hopes to blow away at a Breath, by telling us, <hi>that all this and more,</hi> (the greater their ſhame who have contributed to it, and whither they in whoſe Defence he writes, have not, let <hi>Sixtus Quintus,</hi> and <hi>Clemens Octavus</hi> their Editions of the Bible bear witneſs) <hi>may be with Truth affirm'd of the ſacred Volume of the Bible, whoſe Authority notwithſtanding ſtands firm and unſhaken, and in ſpite of all ſuch like Objections, is the pure Fountain of Life:</hi> But the Compariſon will very little advantage his Cauſe, till he can ſhew too.</p>
               <p n="1">1. That the <hi>Divine Providence</hi> is equally concern'd in pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerving the <hi>Writings of the Fathers</hi> intire, as 'tis in preſerving the <hi>Sacred Volume of the Bible.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. That there is the ſame help to be had in comparing the Writings of any Father among themſelves, as there is in comparing the ſeveral parts of the Bible, as 'tis 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2. 13. <hi>in comparing Spiritual things with Spiritual.</hi> Or,</p>
               <p n="3">3. That there is the ſame <hi>Demonſtration of the Spirit, and of Power,</hi> going along with <hi>the one,</hi> as there is with <hi>the other;</hi> 1 Cor. 2. 4. which, with many others that might be reckon'd up, are all of them very material differences, and ſuch as will no way ſerve <hi>to eaſe</hi> the difficulty under which the Author la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours in this matter.</p>

               <p>But 'tis not my buſineſs to diſparage the ancient Fathers in what they are thus liable to be abuſed, but rather, and that I am ſure is the nearer way to Truth, to Eſtabliſh the Foundation, on which they and every wiſe Builder muſt depend for Strength and Security, and that is, as I before laid it down, as what they are produced for, is agreeable to the <hi>Faith they are brought to aſſert.</hi> I proceed to the ſecond Enquiry, <hi>viz.</hi>

               <p n="2">2. That they <hi>Speak not directly to the matters under Debate,</hi> will be clear, by ſtating</p>
               <p>What the Controverſies between the <hi>Donatiſts, Gnoſticks, Marcionites, Valentinians,</hi> and the Orthodox were, with</p>

               </p>

               <p>NOW this is no more than <hi>Chriſt and his Apoſtles</hi> have foretold: For, firſt, Doth <hi>not our Lord himſelf</hi> foretel, that 'tis <hi>impoſſible but that Offences will come,</hi> Luke 17. 1.</p>
               <p>That there <hi>ſhall ariſe falſe Chriſts, and falſe Prophets, and ſhall ſhew great ſigns and wonders, inſomuch, that if it were poſſible, they ſhall deceive the very elect: Behold, I have told you before,</hi> Matth. 24. 11, 24, 25.</p>
               <p>And after him St. <hi>Paul,</hi> Acts 20. 29, 30. <hi>For I know this, that after my departing ſhall grievous Wolves enter in among you, not ſparing the Flock.</hi> And 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4. 1, 2, 3. <hi>Now the Spirit ſpeaketh expreſly, that in the latter times ſome ſhall depart from the Faith, giving heed to ſeducing Spirits, and Doctrines of Devils; ſpeaking lies in Hypocriſie, having their Conſcience ſeared with a hot Iron: forbidding to marry, and commanding to abstain from meats, which God hath created to be received with thankſgiving of them which believe, and know the Truth. And again,</hi>
               </p>
               <p>2 Tim. 3. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, <hi>&amp;c. This know alſo, that in the laſt days perillous times ſhall come, for men ſhall be lovers of their own ſelves, covetous, boasters, proud, blaſphemers, diſobedient to Parents, unthankful, unholy, without natural affection, truce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>breakers, falſe-accuſers, incontinent, fierce, deſpiſers of thoſe that are good, Traytors, heady, high-minded, lovers of pleaſures more than lovers of God; having a form of Godlineſs, but denying the power thereof.</hi> And doth not the ſame St. <hi>Paul</hi> tell us, 2 <hi>Theſſal.</hi> 2. 7. <hi>that the myſtery of iniquity did already work, that there muſt come a falling away, and the man of ſin, the ſon of Perdition be revealed?</hi> Doth he not (of which by and by) tell us, <hi>what this ſhall be, and what it was that at preſent hindred?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thus likewiſe St. <hi>Peter,</hi> 2 Pet. 2. 1, 2, 3. <hi>But there were falſe Prophets alſo among the people, even as there ſhall be falſe Teachers among you, who privily ſhall bring in damnable Hereſies,</hi>
                  <pb n="14" facs="tcp:44425:30"/> 
                  <hi>even denying the Lord that bought them, and bring upon themſelves ſwift deſtruction: And many ſhall follow their pernicious ways, by reaſon of whom the way of Truth ſhall be evil ſpoken of: And through Covetouſneſs ſhall they, with feigned words, make merchandize of you, whoſe judgment now of a long time lingereth not, and their damna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion ſlumbreth not.</hi> A farther Character of whom is given, <hi>v.</hi> 12, 13, 14, 15, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And</p>
               <p>2 Pet. 3. 3. <hi>Knowing this firſt, that there ſhall come in the laſt days Scoffers, walking after their own lusts,</hi> &amp;c. which St <hi>Jude</hi> repeats, <hi>v.</hi> 18. minding them, <hi>That the Apoſtles of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt had told them, there ſhould be mockers in the laſt time, who ſhould walk after their own ungodly luſts.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And is it likely <hi>they ſhould ſo preſerve the Teſtimony of the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cients,</hi> as to make them <hi>convincing</hi> in the chief points of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverſie, either at preſent, or indeed almoſt in any points un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der debate, whoſe great ſtudy it ſhould be <hi>to corrupt all the principles of the Chriſtian Religion, to ſeduce and deſtroy Chriſts Flock? To bring in Doctrines of Devils, and ſpeak lies in Hypocriſie?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Is it likely they ſhould be the Inſtruments <hi>to preſerve the word of Truth and Salvation,</hi> who are ſo zealous to bring in <hi>damnable Hereſies,</hi> 2 Pet. 2. 1, 2, 3.

               <p>Is it probable <hi>thoſe, who are ready to deny the Lord that bought them,</hi> will ſtick at any thing to advance their <hi>Covetous, Ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious,</hi> and <hi>Carnal Deſigns?</hi> No: If <hi>ſuch</hi> there were to come, 'tis not to be queſtion'd but they would be indifferently zealons to <hi>hold the Truth in Righteouſneſs;</hi> 'tis not to be expect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed <hi>the Man of Sin,</hi> and <hi>Son of Perdition,</hi> ſhould ſcruple at cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupting Truth in the <hi>Chanels,</hi> who makes it his greateſt <hi>gain and intereſt</hi> to ſtop it in <hi>the Fountain.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>So that we ſee there wants not ſufficient Prediction of a very <hi>great Eclipſe the Church,</hi> or <hi>at leaſt great part of it</hi> was to ſuffer; and that ſuch <hi>an Eclipſe as while it laſted,</hi> there was lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle hopes, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 word">

               <p>I ſhall not heap up other Teſtimonies in this matter, <hi>the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers</hi> generally concurring in this opinion <hi>of Antichriſt's being to</hi> ſucceed to the <hi>deſtruction of the</hi> Roman <hi>Empire:</hi> And <hi>Corne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lius à Lapide,</hi> in their names, makes it the common ſenſe they had of this place, <hi>that</hi> Nero <hi>and the</hi> Roman <hi>Emperours were to with-hold, and when they were taken out of the way,</hi> tunc reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>labitur ille iniquus Antichriſtus, <hi>then ſhould be revealed that wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Antichriſt, on</hi> 2 Theſſal. 2. 6.</p>
               <p>Now, that we may come a little cloſer to the Matter in hand, <hi>When was that? when was it the Roman Emperors were taken out of the way?</hi> (For if that be made out, eſpecially ſo as to point any thing near the time he mentions, I ſuppoſe the Author will no longer look upon <hi>thoſe</hi> 10 <hi>Centuries of Sleep, and Corruption in the Church</hi> (as he phraſes it, <hi>Pref.</hi> p. 5.) to be no <hi>more than a Dream of the Reporters,</hi> but both <hi>He and every ſerious Reader</hi> will be awaken'd to ſee thorow his <hi>Nubes Teſtium,</hi> at leaſt to own that there was ſuch a <hi>Cloudy time,</hi> ſuch <hi>an Eclipſe,</hi> as his own Metaphor is, <hi>Pref.</hi> p. 4. <hi>The Church was to ſuffer;</hi> I do not ſay with him for 1000 <hi>Years,</hi> neither <hi>more,</hi> nor <hi>leſs,</hi> but for a <hi>Period</hi> in which <hi>He</hi> and <hi>Thoſe</hi> for <hi>whom</hi> He writes, will be equally concern'd to free themſelves from the charge of <hi>many Novelties). When,</hi> I ſay, <hi>was it, the</hi> Roman <hi>Emperors were taken out of the way?</hi> And methinks it ſhould not be difficult to anſwer the Query, eſpecially the <hi>Holy Ghoſt</hi> himſelf having in a manner herein expreſly directed us, 'tis in the 13th <hi>of the Revelations,</hi> v. 10. <hi>He that leadeth into Captivity, ſhall go into Captivity; He that killeth with the Sword, ſhall be killed with the Sword:</hi> And to make it the more remarkable he calls up our Attention with that Eminent Saying of <hi>our Lord,</hi> ſo often made
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:44425:32"/> uſe of by Him in <hi>the Goſpel,</hi> when He had ſome great, and notable Leſſon to recommend to his Auditors, <hi>If any man have an Ear, let him hear, v.</hi> 9: and cloſes it with no leſs a note of Attention in the following words, <hi>Here is the Patience, and the Faith of the Saints.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now who was it, <hi>who led into Captivity?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Was it not the</hi> Roman <hi>Empire,</hi> that had enſlaved the Nations round about? Was it not the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire, which had ſo inſolently triumpht <hi>over the Christians;</hi> and made them its Vaſſals?</p>
               <p>Who was it was <hi>the great red Dragon, having ſeven Heads, and ten Horns, which ſtood before the Woman cloathed with the Sun, which was ready to be deliver'd for to devour her Child, as ſoon as it was born?</hi> Rev. 12. 1. 5.</p>
               <p>Was it not the <hi>Roman Empire, whilſt Heathen,</hi> which by its <hi>furious Perſecutions</hi> endeavour'd to root out <hi>Chriſtianity?</hi> So that 'tis not to be doubted, <hi>who</hi> is here to be underſtood <hi>by Him, that leadeth into Captivity?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But then, How is it <hi>He was led into Captivity?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Conſult their <hi>own Annals,</hi> and you have the Anſwer: For, Was not <hi>Rome</hi> taken firſt <hi>by</hi> Alaricus <hi>the</hi> Goth <hi>in the</hi> 410<hi>th year after Chriſt?</hi> and again in <hi>the year</hi> 455 <hi>by</hi> Genſericus? Or,</p>
               <p>If not the <hi>taking of</hi> Rome, <hi>but the Captivity</hi> of the Empire it ſelf be to be underſtood hereby, when could this be better verlfied, than, when the <hi>Empire</hi> was torn in pieces, and divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded into <hi>ſeveral Kingdoms,</hi> (thoſe <hi>ten Horns</hi> of which both <hi>Daniel,</hi> and St. <hi>John</hi> ſpeak) <hi>by the</hi> Goths, Vandals, <hi>and</hi> Hunns? And when <hi>happen'd that?</hi> but in or about the ſame Period <hi>of</hi> 455 <hi>or</hi> 456?</p>
               <p>Now then, if in either of theſe <hi>Periods,</hi> viz. of 410 or 455, or thereabout, we grant to be the <hi>time,</hi> when <hi>He that led was taken out of the way,</hi> it will unqueſtionably follow, that,</p>
               <p>'Twas then that <hi>wicked, lawleſs One was revealed:</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Then was the <hi>Birth of Antichriſt,</hi> i. e. <hi>of Him,</hi> who was more eminently to be ſo:</p>
               <p>Then <hi>the time</hi> from whence in <hi>ſuch a Latitude</hi> may be dated that <hi>great Eclipſe, which the Church was to ſuffer;</hi> And beginning with either of theſe, we fall upon what, in <hi>the Event,</hi> will ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremely well anſwer the Prediction.</p>
               <pb n="19" facs="tcp:44425:32"/>
               <p>For if we reckon from 410, then will 666 bring us to the Year 1076, which was the Fourth of <hi>Hildebrand,</hi> or <hi>Gregory</hi> the Seventh; who, as 'tis <hi>Rev.</hi> 13. 13. <hi>made fire to come down from Heaven on the Earth, in the ſight of Men,</hi> i. e. (as we ſhall afterwards ſhew it to be the ſenſe of that Phraſe) ſo openly, and ſolemnly Excommunicated the Emperor: which if conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered in all its Circumſtances, will be but too plain a Deſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of <hi>that Man of Sin and Son of Perdition, who was to oppoſe and exalt Himſelf above all that is called God, or that is worſhipt; ſo that He as God ſitteth in the Temple of God, ſhewing himſelf that He is God.</hi> 2 Theſſal. 2. 3, 4.</p>
               <p>For what is it to <hi>exalt Himſelf above all that is called God; and that is worſhip,</hi> but to aſſume to Himſelf an Authority over <hi>thoſe Higher Powers which God hath ordained,</hi> thoſe <hi>Gods,</hi> as Princes are ſtiled in Scripture, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 82. 1. <hi>Joh.</hi> 10. 34, 35?</p>
               <p>What <hi>as God to ſit in the Temple of God, ſhewing Himſelf that He is God?</hi> but to take to Himſelf the Power of <hi>Saving</hi> or <hi>Damning</hi> men, as He ſhall think fit; <hi>to ſay that he cannot Err,</hi> which is the Incommunicable Attribute of the divine Nature, and arrogate <hi>the ſetting up one, and pulling down another, which can belong only to the Supreme Governour of the Univerſe?</hi> where, not to take notice of any thing done by Him, before he was Pope, by which, as I may ſay, He ſeemed but to be preparing himſelf for the great Service he was to do the Chruch, when advanced to the Pontifical See, his carriage in the difference between the Emperor, and the Saxons, is what I ſhall firſt pitch on; wherein the Biſhops revolting from the Emperor fly to <hi>Hildebrand,</hi> preſent their Complaints againſt the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror; the Pope greedily embraces the Quarrel, and ſo far pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſues it, as to cite the Emperor to appear at <hi>Rome,</hi> and in caſe of his refuſal, threatens Him Excommunication: The Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror terrified herewith, ſends his Ambaſſadors to divert Him from his reſolution; But contrary to the Law of Nations (however <hi>Baronius</hi> labours to contradict this), He Impriſons his Ambaſſadors, and having almoſt deſtroyed them with Hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, Thirſt, and Cold, ſends them out of <hi>Rome</hi> with the greateſt diſgrace.</p>
               <p>Upon this, the Emperor calls a Council at <hi>Wormes;</hi> and in return hereof, cites <hi>Hildebrand,</hi> to appear, imagining the Pope
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:44425:33"/> to have been thereby diſabled to Publiſh his threatned Excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munication: And having written a Letter to the Archbiſhop of <hi>Cologn,</hi> another to <hi>Hildebrand</hi> Himſelf; and a third to the Clergy and Laity of the whole <hi>Roman</hi> Church, and obtain'd not only of the <hi>Germans,</hi> but of ſome of the Biſhops of <hi>Italy</hi> to concurr with Him in the Sentence againſt <hi>Hildebrand;</hi> when the Day came, that the Emperor was cited to appear, <hi>Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>landus</hi> a Prieſt of <hi>Parma,</hi> brings the Emperor's Letters, and without any title of Honour given him, thus beſpeaks him, <q rend="inline">

<pb n="23" facs="tcp:44425:34"/> are true: This Cauſe I under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take for truth's ſake, that my Brethren, whoſe Salvation I earneſtly deſire, may be the better ſatisfied in their Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience to me, may know, and underſtand that relying on your aſſiſtance, next unto Chriſt, and his Mother always a Virgin, I reſiſt the flagitious and unjuſt; but that to the Faithful I am always ready to give aid: For I did not by my own choice, or willingly mount this Chair, but unwil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly, and with Tears, becauſe I judged my ſelf unworthy to ſit in this high Throne: Now theſe things I ſay, becauſe I choſe not you, but ye have choſen me, and laid this moſt heavy burden on our Shoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders. However againſt me aſcending to this high Place by your Command, Proclaim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and telling their People their Wickedneſs, and the Sons of the Church their Sins, the Members of the Devil have riſen up together, and laid hands upon me to Murder me. For the Kings of the Earth ſtood up, and the Rulers of the World, and with theſe ſome of the Churchmen, and the People have conſpired together againſt the Lord, and againſt <hi>us his Chriſts;</hi> ſaying, Let us break their Bonds aſunder, and caſt away their yoke from us: and this they have done, that they might bring us to Death or Baniſhment; of which
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:44425:35"/> number was <hi>Henry,</hi> whom they call King, <hi>Henry,</hi> I ſay, Son of <hi>Henry</hi> the Emperor, who hath too proudly lift up his horn and heel againſt the Church of God, entring into Conſpiracy with many Biſhops of <hi>Italy, Germany,</hi> and <hi>France,</hi> whoſe Pride hitherto your Authority hath reſiſted, who being broken rather, than re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtor'd to a ſound Mind, coming to me on this ſide the <hi>Alps,</hi> humbly begged Abſolution from Excommunication. Him, whom, I believ'd to have come Penitent, I have receiv'd into favour, &amp; reſtored to Him Communion, but not his King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, from which I had depoſed Him in a Synod held at <hi>Rome;</hi> nor did I grant leave to the Tributaries of the Kingdom to return to their Fealty. This I therefore did, that if he ſhould delay to be reconciled to his Neighbours, whom He had aggriev'd, and ſhould re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſe to reſtore both their Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſiaſtical and Civil Rights, He might by Execrations or Cenſures, and Arms be compel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led to his Duty. Being aſſiſted by this Opportunity, ſome Biſhops, and Princes of <hi>Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>many,</hi> who had been long aggrieved by this wild Beaſt, into the place of <hi>Henry,</hi> who by his great wickedneſs and forſeited the Kingdom, choſe Duke <hi>Rodulphus,</hi> who with that modeſty, and integrity which becomes a King, forthwith ſent Meſſengers
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:44425:35"/> to me, by whom I might un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand that He was forced to undertake the Government of the Kingdom; but however that He was not ſo deſirous of Reigning, but that he had ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther obey us, than thoſe who had promiſed the Kingdom; that He would be always in the Power of God and us, and that we might believe that He will do this, hath promiſed to give his Sons Hoſtages. At this <hi>Henry</hi> began to be incens'd and to beſeech us at firſt, that by <note n="*" place="margin">Banning.</note> Curſings we would hinder <hi>Rudolphus</hi> from ſeizing the Kingdom; I ſaid, I would ſee to whom the Right belonged, and for that Reaſon would ſend Meſſengers, who ſhould take Cognizance of the whole Affair, and would judge there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon, whether of them had the better Cauſe? <hi>Henry</hi> forbad, that our Meſſengers ſhould declare him King, and ſlew many of the Clergy and Laity, Robbed, and Profaned ſeveral Churches, and by this means bound himſelf the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter with the Bonds of an Ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thema, or Excommunication denounced againſt him. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore truſting in the Judgment; and Mercy of God, and the Patronage of the Bleſſed Virgin, and ſupported alſo with your Authority, <hi>Henry</hi> himſelf, and his Abettors do I bind with the Bonds of an Anathema, and the ſecond time deprive him of Royal Authority, and forbid all Chriſtians, abſolved of that Oath, whereby Fealty is uſed to be Sworn to Kings, in any
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:44425:36"/> thing to obey <hi>Henry,</hi> and that they accept <hi>Rudolphus</hi> for King, whom many of the Princes of the Province (or Empire) rejecting <hi>Henry,</hi> have choſen to be their good King. For 'tis fit, that as <hi>Henry</hi> for his Pride and contumacy, is deprived of all his Privileges, ſo <hi>Rudolphus,</hi> who is accepta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to all, ſhould for his Piety and Religion be endowed with Royal Dignity and Power. Go to now therefore, ye moſt moſt Holy Princes of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles, and what I have ſaid, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpoſe your Authority to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm, that all men at length may underſtand whether you can bind and looſe in Heaven, and alſo on Earth are not able to take away or give Empires, Kingdoms, Principalities, or whatever elſe mortal Men can enjoy? For it ye can judge thoſe things which belong to God, what are we to think of inferiour and profane things? It it belongs to you to judge the Angels who rule over proud Princes, what doth it become you to do to their Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants? Let Kings and all the Princes of the World now learn by the Example of this <hi>[Henry]</hi> what your Power is in Heaven, and how great you are with God, and let them hereafter dread to contemn the Commands of Holy Church: And this Sentence forthwith execute ye on <hi>Henry,</hi> that all
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:44425:36"/> may know, that 'tis not by mere chance, but through your Aſſiſtance, that the Son of Iniquity hath fallen from the Kingdom: Only this I would requeſt from you, that being led to Repentance, He may through your interceſſion ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Grace in the Day of Judgment.</p>

He that reads his <hi>Sermons</hi> on the Anniverſary of his <hi>Humility,</hi> (that's his uſual Phraſe) being advanced to the <hi>Culmen, onus, munus Pon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tificis ſummi,</hi> will ſee enough of this aſpiring humour, which likewiſe runs thorow ſeveral of his Epiſtles; and 'tis worth our enquiring thereupon, whether this may not be a fit <hi>Epocha</hi> from whence to date the certain Birth of <hi>Antichriſt?</hi> of which we ſhall have occaſion to make uſe in the following diſcourſe.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Baronius</hi> in his Annals ſeems to have ſettled this Point for us, and that not far from this very Period; For <hi>Anno</hi> 452. He aſſerts Him to have been veſted in the title of <hi>Oecumenicus Epiſcopus</hi> by the Synod of <hi>Chalcedon:</hi> and whereas <hi>Gregory</hi> after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards ſaith, <hi>Nullum Praedeceſſorum ſuorum eo nomine uſum eſſe,</hi> that none of his Predeceſſors uſed that ſtile; <hi>Ita quidem</hi> (ſaith Baronius) <hi>intelligendum eſt, ut nemo illorum eo titulo ex ſolenni ritu ſemper, &amp; in omnibus uſus ſit Inſcriptionibus, vel ſub Reſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionibus;</hi> it is indeed to be ſo underſtood, as that none of them did in any ſolemn manner always, and in all <hi>Inſcriptions</hi> or <hi>Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcriptions,</hi> make uſe of it; but for the Right they had to it, He cites <hi>Leo Epiſt.</hi> 54. ('twas the year after the Synod of <hi>Chalcedon)</hi> thus ſtiling himſelf, <hi>Leo Epiſcopus Romanae &amp; Univerſalis Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſiae, Martiano Auguſto:</hi> and he that ſhall read that Epiſtle, will need go no farther to look for one, who began at leaſt to exalt Himſelf, as St. <hi>Paul</hi> had foretold of Antichriſt, 2 <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 2. 4.</p>
               <p>And much good may the ſtile do them; <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 span">
                     <desc>〈…〉</desc>
                  </gap> that very ſtile, which <hi>Gregory</hi> afterward (and I hope his Auth<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap>ity will not be queſtion'd by them) declares to be the very Character of An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tichriſt,
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:44425:38"/> 
                  <hi>Ego fidenter dico, quiſquis ſe univerſalem Sacerdotem vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cat, vel vocari deſiderat, in Elatione ſua Antichriſtum praeourrit, quia ſuperbiendo ſe caeteris praeponit,</hi> l. 4. Epiſt. 30. I boldly ſay, whoever calls himſelf Univerſal Prieſt, or deſires to be ſo called, in his Haughtineſs is the forerunner of Antichriſt, becauſe in thus Priding it, he prefers himſelf before others. And to the ſame purpoſe may be ſeen, <hi>l.</hi> 4. <hi>Ep.</hi> 32. 38, 39. as alſo, <hi>l.</hi> 6. <hi>Ep.</hi> 2 24. 28.</p>
               <p>So then, here are two Periods which both of them anſwer <hi>to the letter of the Text,</hi> viz. <hi>He that leadeth into Captivity, ſhall go into Captivity,</hi> &amp;c. and may reſpectively be applied for the clearing up the matter in hand; The <hi>firſt taking of</hi> Rome, <hi>Anno</hi> 410 gives us a Date, from whence if we reckon 666, we are led to One, who hath as fairly put in for the ſtile of <hi>Antichriſt,</hi> had as much of the mark of the Beaſt, and the number of his Name, as whoever be the Other that can be pitcht on, to vie with him among all <hi>the Children of Pride:</hi> And, as for</p>
               <p>The ſecond taking of <hi>Rome,</hi> Anno 455, that gives us ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Date, (and that's, as I ſhall afterwards ſhew, in a manner confined to this matter,) from whence to begin the whole <hi>Reign of Antichriſt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The <hi>firſt</hi> is a Date that ſpeaks Him not to be riſen, but ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing: As 'tis not to be expected that in a <hi>moment of time</hi> he ſhould leap into his Greatneſs.</p>
               <p>The <hi>ſecond</hi> is a Date, that ſhews Him riſen, and beginning at leaſt to have the marks of Antichriſt upon him; like thoſe, that are ſtricken with the Plague, the Spots may be upon them, though the Diſeaſe not yet come to the heighth, nor ripen'd to all the degrees of its malignity.</p>
               <p>And 'tis not unuſual in Scripture to predict things in <hi>ſuch a Latitude,</hi> as that we may be able to ſerve our ſelves with <hi>any part</hi> of the ſeveral Periods, whereby to reconcile <hi>the Prediction and the Event;</hi> We have an inſtance of this <hi>Dan.</hi> 12. <hi>v.</hi> 11, 12: <hi>And from the time that the daily Sacrifice ſhall be taken away, and the Abomination that maketh deſolate ſet up, there ſhall be a thouſand two hundred and ninety days; Bleſſed is he, that waiteth and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth to the thouſand three hundred and five and thirty days.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In the ſixth Verſe, the Queſtion had been put concerning
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:44425:38"/> the Events which had been there foretold, viz. <hi>How long ſhall it be to the end of theſe Wonders?</hi> And the Anſwer given <hi>by the man clothed in linnen, was, that it ſhould be for a time, times, and an half,</hi> this was the certain time (for 'tis confirm'd by a moſt ſolemn Oath) <hi>for him,</hi> of whom the <hi>Holy Ghoſt</hi> had been ſpeaking, <hi>ch.</hi> 11. 31. <hi>to accompliſh to ſcatter the power of the holy people:</hi> But <hi>Daniel</hi> is ſtill in a doubt, and profeſſes himſelf not <hi>to underſtand this, when he heard it,</hi> and therefore he puts the Queſtion again, <hi>v.</hi> 8. <hi>O my Lord, what ſhall be the end of theſe things?</hi> To which the return is, <hi>v.</hi> 11. And <hi>from the time that the daily Sacrifice ſhall be taken away, and the Abomination that maketh deſolate ſet up, there ſhall be a thouſand two hundred and ninety days. Bleſſed is he that waiteth, and cometh to the thouſand three hundred and five and thirty days.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now what is the reaſon of this difference in the reply? To me it ſeems to be this; the former queſtion is put by one Angel to another, who were no ways concerned <hi>in haſtening</hi> or <hi>deferring the</hi> event, and therefore the <hi>certain</hi> time in Gods Kalender is there prefixt. The <hi>latter question</hi> is put by <hi>Daniel</hi> in behalf of the Church, to whom good things are promis'd, and Evils threatned under the conditions and meaſures of God's dealing with his people; <hi>i. e.</hi> ſo as to take effect according to the <hi>Repentance,</hi> or <hi>Impenitency</hi> of thoſe therein concern'd; according too, <hi>to the ſeveral</hi> degrees by which great Events are to be accompliſh'd, that ſo <hi>the Faith and patience of the Saints</hi> may be accordingly (as I may ſay) <hi>working with Providence, and preparing them</hi> for what in his Wiſe Councils, an Allſeeing God hath ſo ſuited to that varie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty there is in humane affairs; and therefore not without a <hi>latitude</hi> for their <hi>beginning</hi> or <hi>ending: And ſo the Rule is,</hi> Habak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kuk 2. 3. <hi>For the Viſion is for an appointed time, but at the end it ſhall ſpeak, and not lie, though it tarry, wait for it, becauſe it will ſurely come, it will not tarry.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But then, <hi>if Antichriſt were come before the</hi> 500<hi>th year of Chriſt,</hi> what was there did then appear in the World, which could in any ſort anſwer the black Character the Apoſtle gives of <hi>him,</hi> 2 <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 2. v. 4, 8, 9, 10? To this, I anſwer, That as the Apoſtle tells them, to whom he there writes, <hi>That the Myſtery of Iniquity already works,</hi> there is no doubt,
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:44425:39"/> but that he <hi>was born:</hi> (This Myſtery had not been ſo <hi>long conceiving</hi> to <hi>bring forth Nothing)</hi> however he had not then attain'd the <hi>mature age</hi> of <hi>this Man of Sin, and Son of Perdition.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And there will be little reaſon to think otherwiſe, if we conſider, that agreeable to the three Names, by which <hi>the Holy Ghoſt</hi> ſets out the <hi>Reign of Antichriſt,</hi> I mean of <hi>Sodom,</hi> Revel. 11. 4. of <hi>Egypt,</hi> Revel. 11. 8. and of <hi>Babylon,</hi> Revel. 17. 5. the firſt to ſignifie <hi>that Corruption of Manners,</hi> the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond <hi>that Tyranny,</hi> the third that <hi>Superſtition and Idolatry,</hi> which was then to obtain; there was ſomething of all theſe to make out that <hi>Apoſtaſie,</hi> or <hi>falling away,</hi> which was to precede his coming.</p>
               <p>And here not to lead the <hi>Author</hi> beyond his own <hi>Collection of Primitive Fathers,</hi> I could ſhew him <hi>St. Auguſtin, St. Hie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rome, St. Chryſoſtome,</hi> with <hi>many others,</hi> giving Teſtimony in this matter, in their ſeveral <hi>Invectives againſt thoſe Enormities,</hi> which were ſo predominant among the <hi>Clergy,</hi> with thoſe <hi>many burdenſom Rites and Ceremonies,</hi> which were introduced, with the <hi>Adoration</hi> and <hi>Interceſſion of Saints,</hi> and the like, ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient to diſcredit the <hi>Purity of the Church;</hi> and at leaſt, Evidence that <hi>Antichriſt</hi> was at hand.</p>
               <p>I could ſhew, where <hi>St. Hierome</hi> gives <hi>Rome</hi> no other Name than that of <hi>Babylon,</hi> and reproves her for the ſins of <hi>Sodom,</hi> viz. <hi>Pride, Fullneſs of Bread, and abundance of Idleneſs,</hi> and a <hi>refuſing to ſtrengthen the hand of the poor and needy,</hi> Ezek. 16. 49. and ſome degree, at leaſt, of an <hi>Egyptian Tyranny,</hi> (what hath been already obſerv'd of <hi>Leo Magnus,</hi> will go a great way in the proof hereof) <hi>in that high hand,</hi> with which ſhe began then to carry things <hi>in the Church.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>How far they were gone in <hi>Superſtition and Idolatry, Theodoret,</hi> whom the Author ſo often appeals to <hi>in his Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lection,</hi> will ſufficiently inform us, in <hi>his eighth book de Graec. Affect. Curat.</hi> where 'tis his profeſt buſineſs to invite the <hi>Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens</hi> to change the <hi>worſhip of their Pagan Heroes, and Deified Perſons,</hi> into that <hi>of the Martyrs.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>To this I might add the Teſtimony of <hi>Lactantius, Antonius Eremita, Hilarius</hi> and <hi>Epiphanius,</hi> with <hi>Salvian,</hi> and many others: For 'tis no difficulty to make good the Charge.</p>
               <pb n="33" facs="tcp:44425:39"/>
               <p>Only the <hi>advantage</hi> the Author hopes for from it, is, That it being <hi>ſo early, may juſtifie him</hi> in urging this it ſelf as <hi>matter of Antiquity;</hi> the <hi>Uſe</hi> we make of it, is to ſatisfie Him, that theſe <hi>Errors, and Enormities</hi> did ſo ſoon obtain, not that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe <hi>they ſo ſoon obtain'd,</hi> they were therefore the more <hi>juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fiable.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>So then, there's no queſtion, but <hi>Antichriſt</hi> was <hi>then born,</hi> though not arrived <hi>to the adult, and mature age</hi> of the <hi>Man of Sin:</hi>
               </p>
               <p>For that, as we before obſerv'd, was to be reckon'd from another <hi>Epocha,</hi> viz. That of the firſt <hi>taking of</hi> Rome, <hi>Anno</hi> 410. And but reaſonable it ſhould be ſo, <hi>He, who let, being to be taken out of the way,</hi> 2 Theſſ. 2. 7. before the <hi>other Beaſt</hi> (as He is ſtiled <hi>Revel.</hi> 13. 10.) <hi>could come up out of the Earth:</hi> For, 'twas the Anarchy, as St. <hi>Chryſoſtom</hi> expreſſes it, that ſhould make way for his Uſurpation, as <hi>de facto</hi> it did, the Biſhop of <hi>Rome</hi> ſtill holding his own, and indeed gaining by the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Calamity:</p>
               <p>Nor is there any thing, which the Holy Ghoſt himſelf hath more clearly pointed out, then this very <hi>Epocha:</hi> For what are thoſe reflections, I took notice of before, viz. <hi>If any man have an Ear, let him hear,</hi> Revel. 13. 9. and, in the cloſe of the <hi>tenth</hi> verſe, <hi>Here is the Patience, and the Faith of the Saints,</hi> which ſets <hi>the Period</hi> to the <hi>Roman Empire,</hi> and the <hi>Sufferings of the Chriſtians</hi> under <hi>it,</hi> but <hi>to quicken</hi> our attention, as to what is thereby immediately uſher'd in, <hi>ſo to lead us</hi> on to a more ſtrict Obſervation of what follows? which being the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription <hi>of Antichriſt, that other Beaſt,</hi> which was to grow up upon the <hi>Ruins of the Roman Empire,</hi> and being in effect the ſame, with what is foretold of him in that foremention'd 2 <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 2. 7, 8. cannot (eſpecially the <hi>Holy Ghoſt</hi> again point<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to it, <hi>v.</hi> 18. in theſe words, <hi>Here is Wiſdom,)</hi> but guide us to ſome <hi>notable Epocha</hi> of his Reign to be calculated from thence:</p>
               <p>And what was that, but the very time, when He ſhould, (as St. <hi>Paul</hi> had foretold, and I have before taken notice of) <hi>exalt himſelf above all that is called God, or that is worſhipt</hi> (<gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF" extent="1 span">

                  <hi>He is God;</hi> which how, eminently He did it, <hi>Anno</hi> 1076. hath been already ſhew'd.</p>
               <p>But 'tis <hi>his Birth,</hi> not <hi>his mature Age</hi> we are now ſpeaking of; And there's another note of Direction the Holy Ghoſt hath ſupplied us with, <hi>Revel.</hi> 17. 12. which in a manner confines it to the very Period of 455. or the ſecond taking of <hi>Rome;</hi> 'tis that <hi>of the ten Horns,</hi> or <hi>ten Kings,</hi> which when St. <hi>John</hi> wrote, <hi>had receiv'd no Kingdom, but were to receive their Power one hour with the Beaſt; They and He</hi> to commence their Reign <hi>at the ſame time,</hi> and to have the <hi>ſame continuance, and Duration with one another.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And now to ſettle the Synchroniſm, when was it, they, who where thus to be contemporary with the Beaſt receiv'd their Kingdom?

               <p>And whereas <hi>theſe ten Horns</hi> or <hi>ten Kings</hi> are ſaid <hi>Rev.</hi> 17. 13. to <hi>have one mind, and to give their Power, and ſtrength unto the Beaſt,</hi> What is that, but a <hi>Confirmation of the means</hi> whereby <hi>Antichriſt</hi> ſhould arrive at the heighth of his <hi>Uſurpation,</hi> exerciſing, as 'tis <hi>Revel.</hi> 13. 12. all the Power <hi>of the firſt Beaſt</hi> before Him, and cauſing the <hi>Earth,</hi> and <hi>them which dwell therein to worſhip the firſt Beaſt, whoſe deadly wound was healed;</hi> i. e.

Which may be applicable, Either</p>
               <p>For the fixing the time of the <hi>Revelation</hi> of Antichriſt, <hi>i. e.</hi> His coming to his <hi>full growth, or Maturity,</hi> or</p>
               <p>For the ſettling the <hi>Duration of his Reign.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>As to the firſt of theſe, <hi>viz. The fixing the time for the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velation of Antichriſt,</hi> 'tis to be conſidered from whence the Calculation is to be taken, and where to end.</p>
               <p>As to the time from <hi>whence it was to begin;</hi> the Angel tells us, 'twas <hi>from the time that the daily Sacrifice ſhould be taken away, and the Abomination that maketh deſolate, ſet up.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And when was that?</p>
               <p>We have the Hiſtorical Relation of it, <hi>Maccab.</hi> 1. 54. <q rend="inline">Now the fifteenth day of the Month <hi>Caſleu,</hi> in the hundred forty fifth Year, they ſet up the Abomination of Deſolation upon the Altar, and builded Idol-Altars throughout the Cities of <hi>Judah,</hi> on every ſide; <hi>verſ</hi> 55. And burnt Incenſe at the doors of their Houſes, and in the Streets: <hi>verſ.</hi> 56. And when they had rent in pieces the Books of the Law, which they found, they burnt them with Fire. <hi>verſ.</hi> 57. And who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever was found with any of the Books of the Teſtament, or if any conſented to the Law, the Kings Commandment was, that they ſhould put him to Death; <hi>ver.</hi> 58. Thus did they by their Authority to the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> every Month, to as many as were found in the Cities:</q> Which happened to be before Chriſt, 167 Years. Now, take 167 out of 1290, and you leave 1123. But as the learned <hi>Mede</hi> obſerves, we are not to take it from the firſt, but any of the Years of the Profanation of the Temple, which laſting 6 Years, if we take it from the middle, will fall on 1120, the very Year when the forementioned Treatiſe was ſet out by the <hi>Waldenſes,</hi> or <hi>Albigenfes,</hi> declaring Antichriſt to be come: Or,</p>
               <p>If we underſtand it of <hi>the Time his Reign was to continue,</hi> then 'twill not point out ſo much to the time of the <hi>ſetting up the abomination that maketh deſolate,</hi> by <hi>Antiochus Epiphanes; as to</hi>
                  <pb n="71" facs="tcp:44425:59"/> 
                  <hi>that time,</hi> whereof the other was the Type, <hi>i. e.</hi> As we ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved before, to the time when Antichriſt, (for of him, <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiochus</hi> is generally agreed to the be Type) <hi>began to exalt himſelf,</hi> which we ſhewed to belong to the times of <hi>Leo Magnus,</hi> and to fall in with the time, the <hi>ten Horns,</hi> or <hi>ten Kings were to take their Kingdoms,</hi> and that was in, or about 455. From whence reckoning 1290, we are brought to the 1745<hi>th.</hi> year after Chriſt.</p>
               <p>But this exceeding 1260, the Years the <hi>Angel</hi> had before mentioned by 30: If we take out the ſaid 30, will leave 1715: Concerning which, it may be worth our while to enquire, whether in likelihood that be not the time for the <hi>expiration of the Reign of Antichriſt?</hi> (A Period which we are led to from the other meaſures of Prophetick time; which we ſhall have occaſion to take notice of in this fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing Diſcourſe.)</p>
               <p>As, whether with reſpect to the <hi>Jews,</hi> for whom <hi>Daniel</hi> there puts the Queſtion (a thing never yet taken notice of by any, whom I have yet met with) the Year 1745, be not a likely Epocha for <hi>their return to the true Worſhip of God in its full Purity?</hi> As the other is for <hi>the downfal of Antichriſt,</hi> and the <hi>beginning of thoſe happy Times to them,</hi> and the <hi>fulneſs of the Gentiles,</hi> which ſhall be in very great Glory at this Period. As alſo,</p>
               <p>Whether from thence reckoning the <hi>Millennium</hi> to enſue, we have not the <hi>full Period of the Worlds duration.</hi> Or,</p>
               <p>If we take it in the Anſwer <hi>the Angel</hi> had before given to <hi>Daniel, chap.</hi> 8. 14. Of 2300 Days, reckoning them from <hi>the time,</hi> when <hi>Daniel</hi> ſaw the Viſion, which was, (as <hi>Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſius</hi> gives it us in his Chronology) <hi>Anno Mundi,</hi> 3393: or before Chriſt, 555, we fall again upon the ſame number of 1745, for the time of the Viſion concerning the <hi>Daily Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice, and the tranſgreſſion of Deſolation to give both the Sanctua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, and the Hoſt to be trodden under foot,</hi> verſ. 14. And then ſhall <hi>the Sanctuary be cleanſed:</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Which being, as I have obſerved, the anſwer given to <hi>Daniel,</hi> Sollicitous of the Welfare of his People, may very well point out the time for their being called again, and to be received into the Enjoyment of thoſe Glorious things,
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:44425:60"/> which were promiſed them in the <hi>times of the Meſſias.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And the Calculation of it is thus, 555 before Chriſt, ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to 1745 after Chriſt, gives 2300; the Time aſſigned for the fulfilling of thoſe things by the Angel.</p>
               <p>And whatever we are to underſtand by that Phraſe, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it relate to the <hi>Millenium</hi> ſo much ſpoken of; <hi>or the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection</hi> foretold, <hi>verſ.</hi> 1, 2, 3. Or whatever elſe, I leave it to the more Learned at preſent to determine; but whatever we are to underſtand by that Phraſe, 'tis then, 'tis promiſed to <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niel; That he ſhall ſtand in his Lot.</hi> verſ. <hi>ult. But go thou thy way till the End be; for thou ſhalt reſt, and ſtand in thy Lot at the end of thy Days.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But then this number exceeding the other in the ſame place of <hi>Daniel,</hi> viz. <hi>Dan.</hi> 12. 11, 12. by 45. If we take out the ſaid 45, will leave us to conſider what may hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen with relation to that People in the Year 1700: And the iſſue of <hi>the Wars</hi> that are at preſent between the Impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rialiſts, and the <hi>Turks,</hi> with thoſe other <hi>Commotions</hi> which may be very ſhortly expected in the Eaſtern part of the World, will in all likelihood explain this.</p>
               <p>I would not be too poſitive in things of this Nature, but who can be ſilent, where God ſpeaks?

               <head>CHAP. VIII. Some Remarks neceſſary to be premiſed for the clearing up what will afterwards be ſaid of the ſeveral Vials.</head>
               <p n="1">1. THat as to the <hi>time</hi> of pouring out the Vials, it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be till <hi>Antichriſt</hi> ſhould be ſo far advanced, as to have made <hi>an Image to the Beaſt, that had the wound by the Sword, and did live, Revel.</hi> 13, 14.

                  <hi>his Name, and worſhipped his Image,</hi> that the <hi>firſt Vial</hi> was to be poured out. <hi>Rev.</hi> 16. 2.</p>
               <p n="2">2. That it is not neceſſary the <hi>Trumpets and Vials</hi> (it being their ſeveral Objects, and the diſtinct Capacities of thoſe on whom they were to take place, in which they chiefly differ) ſhould be all of them reſtrained to diſtinct times: Some of the Trumpets undoubtedly had ſounded before any of the Vials were to be poured out; but when the time came for theſe to be poured out, they might be co-incident ſome of them with one another. As for the purpoſe;</p>
               <p>The <hi>firſt Trumpet,</hi> and <hi>firſt Vial</hi> I take to be quite different; as I do alſo the <hi>ſecond, third, and fourth Trumpets</hi> from the <hi>Vials;</hi> However in the manner of expreſſing them, they fall in very much with the <hi>ſecond, third, and fourth Vials:</hi> But then for the <hi>fifth Trumpet,</hi> and <hi>three firſt Vials,</hi> I ſee not why they may not ſynchronize.</p>
               <p>The <hi>fourth and fifth Vials</hi> ſeem to ſtand by themſelves.</p>
               <p>The <hi>ſixth Trumpet,</hi> and <hi>ſixth Vial</hi> agree very much in <hi>Time,</hi> and <hi>Subject,</hi> though they differ in their <hi>reſpective Ends:</hi> The <hi>one</hi> being to give the Secular <hi>Antichriſtian</hi> Power its great Blow; the <hi>other</hi> to bring down the <hi>degenerate, Eccleſiaſtical or Papal Power,</hi> and with both to advance the great work of the <hi>Jews Converſion,</hi> and bringing in the <hi>fulneſs of the Gentiles:</hi> The <hi>ſeventh Trumpet,</hi> and <hi>ſeventh Vial</hi> fully compleat the Ruin of all the preſent Enemies of the Church, and what is the great Mortification to them all, are to bring in that Kingdom of Chriſt in its full Glory and Extent, which from thence is always to prevail. As alſo,</p>
               <p n="3">3. That we pretend not to be ſo exact in the <hi>ſeveral Vials,</hi> as if what is given in the <hi>Prediction</hi> could ſuit with no other <hi>Events;</hi> only where the Series of things correſponds with the Text, as it ſeems to do in what we have aſſigned, and an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwers the great end of the Propheſie, we are apt to think what is offered, ought to be received with the greateſt Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dor by all lovers of Truth.</p>
               <p>For I will not ſo inſiſt on any thing of this nature, as to preſume that this, and no other may be the ſenſe of the <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpective Vials,</hi> I know things in Scripture are delivered ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to that of the Pſalmiſt, <hi>(Pſ.</hi> 119. 96. <hi>Thy Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi>

                  <hi>is exceeding broad,)</hi> with <hi>that Latitude,</hi> that many times there is not only a <hi>Myſtical</hi> and <hi>Literal,</hi> but a <hi>general and particular</hi> Interpretation of the ſame Truth, and as in the Type, what <hi>particularly</hi> related to <hi>Egypt,</hi> and its Plagues, may gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally, and in the Antitype be verified of all the Enemies of the Church; As What relates to the <hi>whole Church,</hi> may likewiſe be veriſied to every <hi>particular Chriſtian;</hi> and this is no ſmall part of the Divine Wiſdom, (if I may ſo ſay) to give every one his own Portion; nor will I therefore conteſt it with any, that <hi>thoſe and no other Events,</hi> than what I ſhall point to, can be underſtood by the <hi>ſeveral Vials,</hi> but leave it to the Judgment of. every diſcreet Reader, whether thoſe that ſhall be aſſigned, if they are not excluſive of all other Interpretations, yet do not themſeves however reach the matter in hand.</p>
               <p>And the Truth is, if we are ſo happy as to be in the right, as to the firſt <hi>commencing</hi> and <hi>ending</hi> of <hi>theſe Vials,</hi> (now the reaſon of the thing is our beſt guide here.)</p>
               <p>If we are ſo happy, as to have given the true riſe of Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſt, <hi>An.</hi> 455.</p>
               <p>If ſo happy as to have ſettled the Period for his coming to his heighth, to that maturity, wherein he is the <hi>Man of Sin, and Son of Perdition,</hi> by beginning to reckon for it at 410.</p>
               <p>If ſo happy as to have hit upon the Period, which muſt put en end to his Reign, 'twill be ſufficient that in order thereunto, we have pointed out thoſe Judgments which can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be denied to have fallen upon him, and that in ſuch order of time, as to have given to each a due diſtance, and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinction in the ſeveral ages, wherein they were veri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied.</p>
               <p>And that herein we may give <hi>ſome probable Scheme,</hi> it <hi>may not be amiſs previous</hi> to what we ſhall offer on the <hi>ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Vials,</hi> which are called the <hi>laſt Plagues, Revel.</hi> 15. 1.

               <head>CHAP. IX. What times in all likelihood the <hi>Seals,</hi> and <hi>Trumpets,</hi> and <hi>Vials</hi> under them, point out?</head>
               <p>NOW theſe ſeem to be in this Order:</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The firſt of theſe Seals</hi> ſhews us Chriſt ſetting forth as <hi>a great Conqueror,</hi> and the <hi>Conqueſt</hi> that goes out with Him, is to accompany him through all the <hi>other Seals;</hi> ſo that that is fixed to no particular time, but runs through all the other changes that were to ſucceed in the Church, until it ſhould with him be conſummated in Glory.</p>
               <p>The <hi>three next</hi> carry us through the ten <hi>famous Perſecutions,</hi> the <hi>laſt</hi> of which was ſo memorable, that the <hi>Egyptians</hi> from thence took one of their <hi>Aeras,</hi> calling it <hi>Aera Martymum:</hi> 'Twas that begun under <hi>Diocleſian,</hi> it began in <hi>Egypt</hi> on <hi>Eaſter-Day,</hi> where in one Month ſeventeen Thouſand were Slaugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered. <hi>Quippe certatim glorioſa in certamina ruebatur, multoque avidiùs tum Martyria glorioſis mortibus quaerebantur quam poſtea Epiſcopatus pravis ambitionibus appelebantur;</hi> Men run in in Crouds into the glorious Conflicts, and Martyrdoms were more earheſtly ſought by glorious Deaths, than afterwards Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhopricks were purſued by bafe Ambitions. Of which, <hi>Sulpitius Severus</hi> thus writes, <hi>nullis unquam bellis mundus ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gis exhauſtus, neque majore unquam triumpho vicimus quam cum decem annorum ſtragibus vinci non potuimus;</hi> The World was never more Exhauſted by any Warrs, nor did we ever Conquer by greater Triumph, than when we could not be conquered with the ſlaughters of ten Years. Then it was the <hi>Thaebean</hi> Legion gained their Honour under <hi>Maximian</hi>'s decimation: Then it was here in <hi>Britanny,</hi> there was almoſt a general exciſion of all the Chriſtians, and among them the
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:44425:64"/> ſo famous St. <hi>Alban</hi> ſuffered Martyrdom; in a word, the Perſecution was ſo great throughout all the World, that their Name was well nigh extinct, and a Coin ſtampt by <hi>Diocleſian,</hi> with this Inſcription; <hi>Nomine Chriſtianum deleto qui remp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>evertebant,</hi> the name of the Chriſtians being quite blotted out, who did overturn the Commonwealth.</p>
               <p>And how proper an Introduction was this to the <hi>next Seal,</hi> which ſhews the <hi>Souls under the Altar, crying with a loud Voice,</hi> Revel. 6. 10. <hi>Saying, how long O Lord, Holy and True, doſt thou not judge, and avenge our Blood on them that dwell on the Earth?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The effect whereof, I take to be <hi>Chap.</hi> 13. 10. At the thorow ruin of the Empire, but ſo that in the mean time, a ſhort Triumph is granted to the Church, upon the over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw of <hi>Maxentius</hi> by <hi>Conſtantine,</hi> and with him, of Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ganiſm it ſelf.</p>
               <p>And this is, what I take to be the buſineſs of the <hi>ſixth Seal,</hi> Rev. 6. 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17. After which, till the firſt taking of <hi>Rome,</hi> I take to intervene that <hi>little Seaſon,</hi> which the <hi>Souls under the Altar are bid to reſt, until their fellow-Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants alſo, and their Brethern, that ſhould be killed as they were, ſhould he fulfilled:</hi> Which happened in the Perſecutions of <hi>Julian, Valens, Valentinian</hi> the ſecond, with the many Cruel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties exerciſed on the Orthodox by the <hi>Arrians, &amp;c.</hi> in return whereof, <hi>the cry of the Souls under the Altar</hi> is fully an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered, and the overthrow of the <hi>Roman Empire</hi> wholly ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſhed, <hi>Rev.</hi> 13. 10. at leaſt ſo far, as from that time ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver again to make <hi>Rome</hi> the Seat of it.</p>
               <p>'Tis true indeed, that the <hi>Euſtern</hi> part of the Empire (for ſo it happened upon the Death of <hi>Constantine</hi> to be divided, <hi>viz.</hi> into the <hi>Eaſtern</hi> and <hi>Weſtern</hi> Empire, firſt under <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantius</hi> and <hi>Conſtans,</hi> though ſoon united again, as 'twas again divided under <hi>Honorius</hi> and <hi>Arcadius)</hi> was of longer continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, as not expiring till the year 1453, or thereabout, though much leſſened long before that time <hi>in its extent, viz.</hi> from the Year 800. or thereabout; when <hi>Carolus Magnus</hi> began the new Empire of the <hi>Weſt;</hi> ſoon after which, <hi>viz.

                  <hi>The Voice out of the Temple</hi> ſpeaks it to be from God, and to reſpect the <hi>Affairs of the Church;</hi> and its being ſaid to be a <hi>great Voice,</hi> ſhews the <hi>Terrour</hi> it brings with it, and the <hi>cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Succeſs,</hi> the things it ſpeaks are to have, and that 'tis a <hi>Voice</hi> that will be heard.</p>

               <p>By <hi>Earth</hi> here, as is juſt now obſerved, is ſignified what is op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſite to <hi>Heaven,</hi> ſo that if <hi>Heaven</hi> ſignifies the <hi>Church,</hi> or <hi>Eccleſieſtical State, Earth</hi> will ſignifie what is <hi>Secular,</hi> and <hi>Properly of this World;</hi> and if ſo, it will intimate <hi>this Vial</hi> to concern in the firſt place the <hi>whole Roman Empire,</hi> the <hi>Secu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar, Earthly,</hi> and <hi>Temporal Power</hi> there in Being; but ſo that (as it follows) it ſhall in particular fall on thoſe of <hi>its Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, which had the mark of the Beaſt, and which worſhipped his Image.</hi> And that requires, that we conſider here, 1. what is meant by the <hi>Beaſt?</hi> 2. What it is we are to underſtand by his Mark? 3. What by his Image? And</p>
               <p n="1">1. What is meant <hi>by the Beaſt?</hi>
                  <pb n="87" facs="tcp:44425:67"/> Now 'tis evident that by the <hi>Beaſt</hi> is to be underſtood that <hi>Power,</hi> which roſe up in the place of what was <hi>Imperial:</hi> For ſo 'tis propheſied 2 <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 2. 7, 8.

                  </gap>. As 'tis in <hi>his Preſence</hi> under the <hi>ſhew,</hi> and <hi>covert of his Authority</hi> he doth it: As he permits him to have the name of doing that, wherein he is only his <hi>Tool</hi> to excute ſuch Sentences, as he <hi>(the Pope)</hi> ſhall firſt decree; for there's the whole juggle of delivering up Offenders to the <hi>Secular Power,</hi> which is to proceed againſt them without any farther Tryal, or Cognizance of the cauſe, for which they are thus remitted to the <hi>Civil Magistrate.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And that it is added, <hi>He cauſeth the Earth, and them that dwell therein to worſhip the firſt Beaſt, whoſe deadly Wound was healed;</hi> this muſt be underſtood by conſidering <hi>what his deadly Wound was,</hi> Which in all probability was the blow he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived in having <hi>Paganiſm and Idolatry</hi> (for to that <hi>Worſhipping</hi> will moſt properly relate) beaten down; but not without including alſo that Supream Power, from whence he was caſt down at the diſſolution of the <hi>Weſtern</hi> Empire: Indeed both, <hi>i. e.</hi> The <hi>Imperial Power,</hi> and <hi>Idolatry</hi> under it, went toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, (excepting for the ſhort breathing time Chriſtianity had under <hi>Conſtantine,</hi> and the reſtoring <hi>either</hi> or <hi>both</hi> in <hi>their Image,</hi> muſt denote, as the <hi>ſhew of Power</hi> to which the <hi>Beaſt</hi> again revived after that <hi>deadly Blow</hi> received by the <hi>Goths, Hunns, and Vandals,</hi> ſo that <hi>ſhew of Idolatry,</hi> i. e. That <hi>other ſort of Idolatry,</hi> which under <hi>degenerated Chriſtianity</hi> ſucceeded into the place of what was <hi>Pagan,</hi> or <hi>meerly Heatheniſh;</hi> the reaſon in all likelihood why the <hi>outward Court</hi> (whether to be

               </p>
               <p>So then it is evident, what we are to underſtand by <hi>the Beaſt?</hi> i. e. the <hi>Supream Power,</hi> as 'tis now uſurped by the <hi>Pope,</hi> though in the ſhew of it given <hi>to him,</hi> who wears the name of <hi>Emperor,</hi> raiſed to that <hi>Stile</hi> and <hi>Power</hi> by the <hi>Pope</hi> (for ſo <hi>Carolus Magnus,</hi> and his Succeſſors were) and upheld therein in order to that <hi>Power,</hi> which he and his followers have from that time exerciſed before him.

               <p n="2">2. What we are to underſtand by <hi>his</hi> Mark?</p>
               <p>And that, I queſtion not, is well applied to that <hi>Profeſſion of Errors, and wicked Practices</hi> the <hi>Pope</hi> requires from his fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowers: The <hi>former</hi> very properly ſaid to be the <hi>mark in the Forehead,</hi> as the <hi>latter</hi> is, <hi>in the Hand.</hi> And,</p>

               <p>The Controverſie, as is already obſerved, began about the Year 725, and laſted till about 840, and gives the faireſt Riſe imaginable for our Conjecture of what was the Buſineſs of <hi>the firſt Vial,</hi> viz. <hi>the Judgment</hi> that overtook this <hi>great Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption of the Church,</hi> in the <hi>Irruptions of the Saracens,</hi> the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter more ſtrictly now to be enquired into.</p>
               <p>And for this, methinks we have a very proper Key in what the <hi>Holy Ghoſt</hi> aſſigns for the <hi>Subject of this Plague, as it was to be upon the Men which had the Mark of the Beaſt, and wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhipped his Image;</hi> which if to be underſtood of thoſe who had given up themſelves to <hi>that Idolatry,</hi> or <hi>Image-worſhip</hi>

                  <hi>AND the ſecond Angel poured out his Vial upon the Sea, and it became as the Blood of a dead Man, and every living Soul died in the Sea.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The <hi>Sea</hi> is the great <hi>Confluence of Waters,</hi> and <hi>Waters,</hi> we know, the Angel interpreting it to St. <hi>John, Rev.</hi> 17. 15. ſignifie <hi>Peoples, Multitudes, Nations,</hi> and <hi>Tongues;</hi> which being ſaid to become as the <hi>Blood of a dead Man, and every Soul dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in it,</hi> may import very <hi>great Saughters, and univerſal Blood<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed</hi> among thoſe, who are to be the Subjects of this <hi>Vial.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now what can better interpret this, than the <hi>Cruſado's,</hi> or <hi>Holy Wars,</hi> wherein ſo much Blood was ſpilt? And to this the Series of Hiſtory naturally leads us; for if in the pouring out of the <hi>former Vial,</hi> the <hi>Saracens</hi> invade the <hi>Weſtern Empire,</hi> and thoſe therein (for 'tis obſervable, indeed it could not be otherwiſe, it being commanded them, <hi>that they ſhould not hurt any but only thoſe who have not the Seal of God in their Foreheads,</hi> Rev. 9. 4. That in all the Invaſions and Wars the <hi>Saracens</hi> or <hi>Turks</hi> have made, that they have never bent their Force againſt thoſe who diſclaimed the Idolatries of <hi>Antichriſt,</hi> thoſe they were, againſt whom, neither then nor in later times they ſeem to have had their Commiſſion) <hi>that had the mark of the Beaſt, and worſhipped his Image,</hi> 'tis but in a way of Retaliation that thoſe <hi>who had the Mark of the Beaſt, and worſhipped his Image,</hi> ſhould carry back the War into the Territories of the <hi>Saracens,</hi> to revenge their former Incurſions, to <hi>recover Paleſtine, with Jeruſalem, and the Temple of the Sepulcher</hi> out of the hands of the Infidels.</p>
               <p>Accordingly <hi>Urban the Second</hi> in purſuit of what he knew to have been often attempted by his Predeceſſor, <hi>Gregory</hi> the Seventh, (but wherein he was hindred by the Factions
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:44425:70"/> of Schiſmaticks, and ſeveral Wars, (ſo <hi>Baronius</hi> tells us <hi>Anno</hi> 1090,) and at the inſtance of <hi>Alexius</hi> the Emperor of <hi>Conſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinople,</hi> whoſe Letters had been lately read in the Council of <hi>Placentia,</hi> declares the firſt Expedition in the Council of <hi>Clare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mont</hi> called chiefly for this work; the ſecond Canon whereof was this, <hi>Quicunque proſolâ devotione, non pro, Honoris vel lucri adeptione, ad liberandam Eccleſiam Dei Jeruſalem profectus fuerit, iter illud pro omni poenitentiâ reputetur: Whoſoever out of meer Devotion, and not for the getting of Honour, or Gain, ſhall go to</hi> Jeruſalem <hi>to deliver the Church of God, let that Journey be accounted in the ſtead of all Repentance whate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver;</hi> and for the farther encouragement of thoſe who ſhould un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertake the Expedition, in one of the Speeches he makes on this occaſion, as <hi>Malmsburienſis</hi> relates it, 'tis decreed by him, <hi>omnia bona eorum, qui Hieroſolymas pergunt, ſemper &amp; ubique eſſe ſalva in pace, &amp; treuga, quouſque redierint: That all the Goods of thoſe who go to</hi> Jeruſalem <hi>ſhould always and every where be ſafe, in Peace and Truce, till they ſhall return.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And now what haſtening is there to <hi>this Holy War,</hi> in which they ſhould thus merit the Pardon of all their Sins, and be ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure that all their Goods and Poſſeſſions ſhould be kept in ſafe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty for them? <hi>ſuch</hi> (ſaith <hi>Baronius)</hi> were <hi>the Crouds</hi> of thoſe who liſted their Names, that 'twas neceſſary to dehort <hi>them</hi> from going, whoſe <hi>Age</hi> and <hi>Health</hi> were not fit for military <hi>Service:</hi> Very great indeed were their numbers; <hi>Malmsbu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rienſis</hi> thinks that if the ſeveral Armies had been entred in one Muſter-Roll, they would have made ſixty hundred thouſand: He that ſhall conſider this, with the great Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cruits that were afterwards made in the continuance of thoſe Wars, and the ſmall number of thoſe who ever returned to give an account of their great Exploits there, will not at all wonder that the Holy-Ghoſt ſhould pleaſe to expreſs it by <hi>a Sea of Blood.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Indeed <hi>Urban,</hi> as well as his Predeceſſor <hi>Gregory</hi> the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venth, (who firſt deſigned the Expedition, though he could never bring it to any effect) and thoſe of <hi>his Succeſſors,</hi> who were herein concerned, were well adviſed in the Policy of the Deſign: For what could be more for the advantage of that exorbitant Power at which they aimed, than to give this
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:44425:70"/> diverſion to thoſe neighbouring Princes, which they had rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon to fear would ſtand in their way? Though neither could they do that ſo effectually, as not at the ſame to be neceſſitated to Wars at Home: what with other <hi>Antipopes</hi> (as they were ſet up ſometimes by the <hi>Emperor,</hi> ſometimes be <hi>Faction</hi> among themſelves, ſometimes by <hi>other Princes)</hi> what with the <hi>Emperor,</hi> and thoſe <hi>other Princes</hi> which abetted the <hi>Faction,</hi> or for other reaſons were at Enmity with the <hi>Pope,</hi> nothing but <hi>Blood</hi> was the effect of this <hi>Vial;</hi> Blood, like <hi>that of a dead Man,</hi> and every <hi>living Soul</hi> died in the Sea: <hi>i. e.</hi> Not every <hi>individual Perſon</hi> but ſome of all <hi>ſorts, and in all places, throughout the whole Sea,</hi> in the Senſe we have above given of it, <hi>periſhed in theſe Slaughters;</hi> ſo <hi>univerſal</hi> as well as <hi>fatal</hi> was this <hi>Plague</hi> to thoſe who had <hi>the mark of the Beaſt, and worſhipped his Image.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And herein we place the Buſineſs of the <hi>ſecond Vial,</hi> in diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction from what the <hi>third</hi> holds forth to us, which being to be poured out upon the <hi>Rivers and Fountains of Waters,</hi> as the other was <hi>upon the Sea,</hi> ſeems to denote <hi>that Vial</hi> to be of the <hi>ſame nature</hi> with the former, but <hi>more restrained as to its extent, and the quality</hi> of thoſe, who are to be the Subjects of it.</p>
               <p>I know very well there were <hi>other very ſignal Events,</hi> which fell out about thoſe times, which will very well de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve our conſideration in this matter, as being very capable of the <hi>Character,</hi> that is here given to the <hi>firſt Vial, viz. of a noiſome and grievous ſore upon the men which had the mark of the Beaſt, and which Worſhipp'd his Image;</hi> ſuch were what happen'd to them from the <hi>Berengarians</hi> and <hi>Waldenſes, or Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bigenſes,</hi> thoſe great <hi>Witneſſes</hi> (I was almoſt going to ſay the <hi>two Witneſſes)</hi> which ſo long <hi>Propheſied in Sackcloath, i. e.</hi> under the Perſecutions of the <hi>Romiſh Church;</hi> by the former of theſe, <hi>Wernerus Carthuſianus, Faſc.

               </p>
               <p>And 'tis obſervable, that <hi>Alexander the Third,</hi> in the Canon publiſh'd againſt them, <hi>In Synodo Turonenſi, Anno</hi> 1163. gives it a Name not altogether unlike to this of a <hi>ſore and grievous wound,</hi> affirming it to ſpread <hi>more Cancri,</hi> as a Canker, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and particularly forbids to <hi>buy and ſell,</hi> Revel. 13. 17.</p>

               <p>In the Year 1170, he fends one of the Cardinals to make War upon them, and indeed what is there that could be at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempted, that the <hi>Romaniſts</hi> have not done to deſtroy them, but with no better ſucceſs than to encreaſe them by this oppoſition?</p>
               <p>So <hi>noiſom and grievous, ſo painſul and fretting hath the Sore</hi> ſtill been, which by <hi>theſe fell upon the Men which had the Mark of the Beaſt, and which worſhipped his Image.</hi>

               <p>But then, whether this may be reckoned <hi>one of the parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Vials</hi> I am ſomething doubtful, it being <hi>a Sore</hi> that ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed rather to run through them all, and what either the <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rengarians,</hi> or the <hi>Waldenſes,</hi> or <hi>Albingenſes</hi> (or whatever o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther name is given them) witneſſed againſt the <hi>growing Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptions of the Romiſh Chnrch,</hi> being rather to point out <hi>her Sins,</hi> for which <hi>the Vials</hi> were poured out: But if a <hi>Particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Vial</hi> it be allowed to be, it muſt come in in the ſecond place, and then <hi>the Sea</hi> (upon which it is ſaid to be poured) <hi>becomming as the Blood of a Dead Man, and every living Soul dying in it,</hi> wil ſignifie that <hi>ſtagnation,</hi> if I may ſo expreſs it, there was in all <hi>its Veins,</hi> that mortified State into which the <hi>whole Church of Rome</hi> was every where brought, that ſtop ſhe received in all her <hi>Vital Actions,</hi> i. e.

               <p>Now what can better ſuit this Prediction, than what happen'd in the <hi>later Cruſadoes,</hi> or <hi>Expeditions</hi> to the <hi>Holy Land,</hi> which were not <hi>ſo general</hi> as the <hi>firſt,</hi> and wherein only <hi>ſome particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Princes</hi> were concern'd?</p>
               <p>The Effuſion of blood, though great, yet 'twas but on the <hi>Rivers,</hi> and <hi>Fountains of Waters,</hi> 'twas not that <hi>Sea of blood,</hi> which in the firſt <hi>Cruſadoes</hi> overflowed all <hi>Chriſtendom.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But there's another circumſtance that muſt not be paſt by, and that is, As <hi>this Vial</hi> is ſaid to <hi>be poured out</hi> particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly <hi>on the Fountains of Waters,</hi> by which, as is above offered, are to be underſtood <hi>Princes;</hi> and how it affected them, will not be doubted, if beſides the loſs they ſuſtain'd in the ſlaughter of their Subjects, we ſhall conſider what in the
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:44425:72"/> time of the Cruſadoes they ſuffer'd too <hi>in their Soveraignty.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>For was it not then, that the Biſhops of <hi>Rome</hi> taking the advantage of their abſence, whilſt in their Expeditions to the <hi>Holy Land,</hi> contrary to what had been decreed by <hi>Ur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ban</hi> (viz. <hi>That all the Goods of thoſe, who go to</hi> Jeruſalem, <hi>ſhould always, and every where be ſafe in Peace and Truce, till they ſhould return)</hi> ſo infinitely encreaſed his <hi>own Power,</hi> and leſſen'd <hi>theirs,</hi> abſolutely poſſeſſing himſelf of <hi>ſome of their Kingdoms,</hi> and making others hold theirs as <hi>Feudatory</hi> from him? And this but agreeable to what <hi>Urban</hi> had Decreed in the Council of <hi>Claremont,</hi> wherein he likewiſe Publiſh'd the firſt of theſe Expeditions, <hi>viz.</hi>

               <p>From whence it appears what it was, they were then aim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing at, and how far they effected it, <hi>this Vial</hi> doth ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently declare.</p>
               <p>And this but as a <hi>proper Puniſhment</hi> for <hi>their Sins;</hi> for if <hi>Kings and Princes</hi> be ſo negligent of <hi>his Honour,</hi> who ſet them on <hi>their Thrones,</hi> as to fall down before <hi>Stocks and Stones,</hi> and worſhip whatever <hi>Idols Antichriſt</hi> ſhall ſet up; how can they expect, but that God ſhould give them up to <hi>the Vanities</hi> to which they had proſtituted themſelves, as 'tis <hi>Pſal.</hi> 106. 36. that <hi>their Idols they have ſerved, ſhould be their ſnare?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>As how ſhould they, who are <hi>Gods Vicegerents,</hi> his <hi>Vicars</hi> on Earth, (There was a time, when the Popes themſelves could give them that Stile) and yet ſo far forget him, <hi>whoſe ſubſtitutes</hi> they are, as to <hi>change the Glory of the uncorruptible God, into an Image made like corruptible man, and to Birds, and fourfooted Beaſts, and creeping things,</hi> Rom. 1. 23. or any <hi>other Image,</hi> hope that he ſhould maintain <hi>their Rights,</hi> who ſo highly invade <hi>his Prerogative?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This being conſider'd as the <hi>Reaſon of the thing,</hi> and the <hi>event</hi> anſwering the <hi>obſervation,</hi> I ſhall only add for the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinguiſhing thoſe <hi>two Plagues or Vials</hi> from each other, the time which I think may very well be aſcribed to either; and

                  <hi>to the firſt</hi> I aſſign that interval of time, which comes in be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the year 1095.

And I heard a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother out of the Altar ſay, Even ſo Lord God Almighty, true and righteous are thy Judgments;</hi> which <hi>three Verſes</hi> I take to be a reflection on the <hi>three preceeding Vials,</hi> and not only to belong to the <hi>laſt of them:</hi> Indeed it ſeems to be like the anſwer to the <hi>Cry of the Souls under the Altar,</hi> under the fifth Seal, <hi>ch.</hi> 6. 9, 10. <hi>that were ſlain for the word of God, and for the Teſtimony they held, who cryed with a loud Voice, ſaying, How long O Lord, Holy and true, doſt thou not Judge, and avenge our Blood on them that dwell on the Earth?</hi> For <hi>it is out of the Altar, another Angel ſays,</hi> confirming the applauſe the <hi>former</hi> had gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven to the <hi>divine Juſtice; even ſo Lord God Almighty, true and righteous are thy Judgments.</hi>

               </p>

                  <hi>AND the fourth Angel poured out his Vial upon the Sun, and power was given unto him to ſcorch Men with Fire.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>And Men were ſcorcht with great Heat, and blaſphemed the Name of God, which hath Power over theſe Plagues, and they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pented not to give him Glory.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>By the <hi>Sun,</hi> I am apt to think can be meant nothing but <hi>Antichriſt</hi> in his <hi>higheſt Glory,</hi> ſuch is what he arrived at, when, as hath been ſhewed in the <hi>preceeding Vials,</hi> he had ſo far gained the Aſcendant of thoſe in <hi>Soveraign Power,</hi> as to make them like the <hi>Moon and Stars,</hi> to ſhine only with the borrow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Light they had from him; <hi>i. e.</hi> No farther to exerciſe <hi>thoſe relieks of Soveraignty,</hi> which ſtill remained in them, than <hi>He</hi> thought fit to give way to it.</p>
               <p>And if ſo, then the <hi>Vial</hi> poured upon <hi>the Sun, and Power thereby given him to ſcorch Men with Fire,</hi> will be very well interpreted by the continuance of that high <hi>Uſurpation and Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranny,</hi> over the ſecular <hi>Powers, and their Subjects,</hi> (for ſo <hi>Men</hi> may not unfitly be conſtrued;) but then <hi>theſe Uſurpations and Tyranny</hi> being expreſt by <hi>ſcorching with Fire,</hi> will direct to ſomething that will anſwer that Alluſion: and nothing cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:44425:75"/> more fit to do this, <hi>than thoſe Excommunications,</hi> which were ſo frequent with them, and made uſe of upon every oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion to ſupport <hi>Antichriſt,</hi> and <hi>his Cauſe:</hi> And Mens <hi>blaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheming the name of God, which hath Power over theſe plagues, upon their being ſcorched with great Heat,</hi> i. e. <hi>fretted and vexed</hi> with theſe Darts, <hi>but withal, not repenting to give him Glory,</hi> may very aptly be explained by the great <hi>regret, and deep reſentments</hi> they had againſt the <hi>Papal Tyranny,</hi> but yet ſo, that whatever <hi>their prejudices</hi> againſt <hi>the Pope</hi> were, and his Uſurpations, they continued ſtill in the <hi>profeſſion of that corrupt Religion,</hi> he taught.</p>
               <p>For this is, not <hi>to give Glory to God;</hi> to let the <hi>puniſhment</hi> loſe the <hi>end</hi> for which it was ſent, by not being <hi>amended by it;</hi> which being the condition of thoſe who had the <hi>Mark of the Beaſt, and worſhipped his Image,</hi> 'tis no wonder the <hi>Judgment</hi> is ſtill continued on them, and that by the means of <hi>the Beaſt himſelf;</hi> it being but righteous with God thus to avenge him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf on thoſe who are ſo ſtupid, as not to take his <hi>former warnings.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Nor indeed could it well be otherwiſe, it being by ſuch Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orbitances, that <hi>Antichriſt</hi> was to riſe to <hi>that heighth of Impiety,</hi> which was at laſt to be puniſhed <hi>with the final ruin of himſelf,</hi> and all <hi>his wicked and incorrigible Adherents.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But then a little to ſee, how it was <hi>this Sun</hi> under <hi>this Vial had power given him to ſcorch Men with Fire,</hi> and <hi>what the great Heat was, with which Men were ſcorched?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>How Fire</hi> was <hi>brought down</hi> from Heaven by <hi>Hildebrand,</hi> or <hi>Gregory the ſeventh,</hi> we have above touched it, <hi>ch.</hi> 5. <hi>p.</hi> 19. With relation to the <hi>Excommunications</hi> by him thundered out againſt <hi>the Emperor,</hi> and ſhall now, for the farther explicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of it only add, that there's nothing more familiar with the <hi>Popes</hi> themſelves, than to expreſs ſuch their <hi>Cenſures</hi> by <hi>Thun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der and Lightning,</hi> which in the propriety of Speech <hi>is Fire from Heaven;</hi> and if we conſider theſe <hi>in the end</hi> to which they pretended to make them ſerve, was it not to ſignifie <q rend="inline">

               <p>'Tis true indeed, applying this to <hi>Hildebrand,</hi> there was ſomething in that <hi>Inſolent Uſurper</hi> that ſeemed literally to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain this; for ſo <hi>Cardinal Benno</hi> in his Book Entituled, <hi>Vita &amp; geſta Hildibrandi,</hi> &amp;c. relates it, <q rend="inline">

He cauſes ſome of the Electors to chuſe <hi>a new Emperor,</hi> and to <hi>depoſe Lewis,</hi> whom he had branded with the Stile of <hi>Heretic,</hi> and <hi>Schiſmatick.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And here I ſhall put a ſtop to what I have to ſay on this head, the <hi>Princes</hi> of the Empire upon the occaſion of the Treatment <hi>Lewis</hi> met with for ſo many years together from ſeveral of the <hi>Popes,</hi> having, as I may ſay, put their ſtop too to this <hi>Exorbitant Power,</hi> the <hi>Popes</hi> had for ſeveral Ages tyran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nized over them with; For ſo it was deereed at <hi>Franck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort,</hi> Anno 1347. That <hi>the Yoak of the Pope ſhould be caſt off, quòd ſervus ſervorum faſtu, libidineque dominandi, ita inſaniat &amp; in preceps abeat: Becauſe he who was the Servant of Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants,</hi>
                  <pb n="106" facs="tcp:44425:77"/> out of an <hi>Haughtineſs and Luſt of Ruling, did ſo rage and run headlong into ſuch raſh and precipitate things:</hi> And as for <hi>Charles the</hi> 4<hi>th.</hi> (whom the aforeſaid <hi>Clement</hi> had cauſed to <hi>be choſen</hi> Emperor in the place of <hi>Lewis,</hi> whom he had depoſed) they deny him to be <hi>lawfully choſen,</hi> as being neither <hi>choſen</hi> nor <hi>Crowned</hi> in the <hi>Places proper for either,</hi> as alſo becauſe it was all a <hi>clancular proceeding,</hi> and when there was no <hi>Vacancy of the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire;</hi> whereupon they chuſe <hi>King Edward the third</hi> of <hi>England;</hi> but <hi>he having Affairs of his own to mind, returns his Thanks for the great honour done him,</hi> and <hi>waves it.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The <hi>Pope</hi> however ſends his <hi>Legate</hi> after the Death of <hi>Lewis,</hi> to abſolve the <hi>Princes of the Empire, who adhered to Lewis,</hi> on condition they <hi>would ſwear that the Emperor had no Power to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe the Pope,</hi> and that <hi>from thenceforward they would not obey their Emperor, unleſs he be approved as Emperor by the Pope:</hi> The <hi>Eccleſiaſticks</hi> moſt readily approve this, and the <hi>Laicks</hi> as fierce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly oppoſe it; whereupon the Pope is forced to abate ſomething (let me ſo expreſs it) of this <hi>great Heat,</hi> with which they had ſo <hi>long ſcorched Men,</hi> and <hi>remit this Oath,</hi> and <hi>abſolve</hi> them from the <hi>Excommunication.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And this may be ſufficient to explain this Vial: Only here, as before, it will be asked what is this to the <hi>Fall of Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſt?</hi> Theſe and ſuch like Inſtances, (for many more might be given, and particularly in our own Story, witneſs (1.) the Controverſy between <hi>William the ſecond,</hi> and <hi>Urban</hi> the ſecond, <hi>Anno</hi> 1097. in the Caſe of <hi>Anſelm</hi>'s <hi>appealing to the Pope,</hi> who was thereupon about to Excommunicate the King, but ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving a little before excommunicated the <hi>Emperor Henry the fourth,</hi> he forbore it, leſt otherwiſe <hi>Excommunications</hi> by be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing made common, might be ſlighted; as alſo (2.) between <hi>him,</hi> and <hi>Henry the firſt,</hi> in the caſe of <hi>Inveſtitutes,</hi> in which <hi>Anſelm</hi> likewiſe oppoſed the King in behalf of the <hi>Pope</hi>'s <hi>Pretenſions to them.</hi> (3.)

               </p>
               <p>The <hi>ſecond</hi> or <hi>ſixth</hi> is likewiſe on <hi>Antichrist,</hi> though ſo as to affect the <hi>whole Seat</hi> of the <hi>Roman</hi> and <hi>Mahometan Empires,</hi> i. e.

               </p>
               <p>And as for the <hi>third</hi> or <hi>ſeventh,</hi> it is to end in the <hi>final Ruin of both,</hi> and all the <hi>Antichriſtian Powers</hi> under <hi>them;</hi> or rather in the <hi>Kingdom of Chriſt</hi> ſet up againſt <hi>Antichriſt</hi> in its utmoſt extent, in that <hi>laſting Triumph,</hi> he ſhall then give his Church <hi>over him,</hi> and all <hi>other her Enemies.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But then, as <hi>in this Vial,</hi> we have been now ſpeaking of, ſo in <hi>that</hi> which next follows, this will be again to be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved, that it is not neceſſary it ſhould immediately ſucceed the other; or not to be <hi>to begin,</hi> till the other is <hi>fully expired;</hi> no, it is neceſſary in the nature of the thing, that <hi>ſeveral of the Vials ſhould be contemporary with one another,</hi> foraſmuch as they are <hi>Puniſhments for Sin,</hi> and did not the <hi>Sin continue</hi> (to which Men are often judicially given up) the <hi>Puniſhment</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted <hi>for it,</hi> would not be ſo agreeable <hi>to the manner of Gods proceeding in the ways of his Judgment,</hi> the Rule being, <hi>Iſaiah</hi> 27. 9. <hi>By this therefore ſhall the Iniquity of</hi> Jacob <hi>be purged, and this is all the fruit to take away his Sin.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now then <hi>theſe</hi> being ſpoken of <hi>as diſtinct Vials,</hi> i. e.

               </p>
               <p>Now, when happened <hi>this,</hi> but when <hi>Clement</hi> the fifth <hi>Anno</hi> 1305, being choſen Pope in his abſence in <hi>France,</hi> called the <hi>Cardinals</hi> thither, and ſettled his Reſidence <hi>at Avignon?</hi> 'Twas now the <hi>City that was full of People, ſat ſolitary,</hi> and <hi>became as a Widdow; now ſhe that was great among the Nations, and Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs among the Provinces, became Tributary,</hi> Lam. 1. 1.

               <p>For was it not too in this Seaſon, <hi>that the Goſpel</hi> was made to give place to the <hi>Papal Conſtitutions,</hi> the <hi>Word of God made of none Effect through the Traditions of Men? Mark</hi> 7. 13. I mean in <hi>that Authority</hi> to which the <hi>Canon-Law</hi> was advanced? Which being begun by <hi>Cyratian Anno</hi> 1145, enlarged by <hi>Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niface</hi> the 8th, <hi>Anno</hi> 1298, and having the <hi>Clementines</hi> added to it by <hi>Clemeus</hi> the 5th, <hi>Anno</hi> 1308, and the Extravagancies by <hi>John the</hi> 22d, <hi>Anno</hi> 1320, became the <hi>Rule and Standard</hi> of Popery.</p>
               <p>And what could this produce, but the <hi>groſſeſt darkneſs</hi> in the <hi>Kingdom of the Beaſt?</hi> For what muſt the <hi>miſt</hi> be, that is caſt hereby upon <hi>the Underſtandings of Men,</hi> when inſtead of that <hi>Word</hi> which is a <hi>Lamp unto our Feet, and a Light unto our Path,</hi> Pſalm 119. 105.

               <p>But one thing more is to obſerved of <hi>this Vial,</hi> as it was <hi>poured out</hi> upon the <hi>Seat of the Beaſt;</hi> and that was, as now <hi>Princes</hi> began to deſpiſe the Power <hi>of the Popes,</hi> and make themſelves their <hi>Judges;</hi> it was what <hi>they</hi> had ſometimes <hi>at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempted before,</hi> but the <hi>Popes</hi> ſtill got the better of them in the <hi>conteſt;</hi> but now they effectually made them <hi>to be depoſed,</hi> and ſubmitted them to the <hi>Authority of Councils,</hi> as in <hi>that of Conſtance:</hi> Nay, <hi>they</hi> came to that <hi>Indiffereucy,</hi> that <hi>ſeveral of them</hi> owned neither the <hi>Pope</hi> at <hi>Rome,</hi> nor at <hi>Avignon;</hi> and <hi>Charles</hi> the 6th King of <hi>France</hi> went ſo far, as by a <hi>publick E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dict</hi> to decree, <hi>ne quis ſuorum Romanum, aut Avenionem excut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reret ad Pontifiem, That none of his Subjects ſhould go either to</hi> Rome <hi>or</hi> Avignon <hi>to the Pope.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Beſides, it was what did <hi>not a little</hi> encreaſe their <hi>pains, and ſores,</hi> what happened to the Seat of the Beaſt under <hi>this Vial,</hi> from <hi>Wiclef, and his Followers,</hi> who ſo highly declaimed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Pope, as being <hi>Antichriſt,</hi> and ſo ſtronuouſly oppoſed the <hi>Doctrines of Purgatory,</hi> of <hi>Images,</hi> of <hi>Invocation of Saints,</hi> of <hi>Tranſubſtantiation,</hi> of <hi>Indulgences,</hi> &amp;c. For however <hi>Wiclef</hi>'s Doctrine was condemned at <hi>Conſtance, Jerome</hi> of <hi>Prague,</hi> and <hi>John Hus</hi> Burnt for defending it, yet how did the <hi>Light</hi> of the Goſpel by them Preached, begin to diſpel the <hi>Miſts and Clouds</hi> which this <hi>Kingdom of Darkneſs</hi> had caſt abroad? How did it but make way for <hi>that clearer Light,</hi> which ſhone forth yet clearer at <hi>the Reformation?</hi> When according to <hi>Hus</hi>'s <hi>Prophecy,</hi> (viz. <hi>Nunc quidem torretis Anſerem, at veniet Cycnus, quem non poteritis torrere, poſt centum Annos Deo, &amp; mihi reſpon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>debitis:</hi>

               <head>CHAP. XVI. Of the ſixth Vial, <hi>Rev.</hi> 16. 12, 13, 14, 15, 16.</head>
               <p>
                  <hi>AND the ſixth Angel poured out his Vial upon the great River</hi> Euphrates, <hi>and the Water thereof was dried up, that the way of the Kings of the</hi> Eaſt <hi>might be prepared.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>And I ſaw three unclean Spirits like Frogs come out of the Mouth of the Dragon, and out of the Mouth of the Beaſt, and out of the Mouth of the falſe Prophet.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>For they are the Spirits of Devils, working Miracles, which go forth unto the Kings of the Earth, and of the whole World, to</hi>
                  <pb n="113" facs="tcp:44425:80"/> 
                  <hi>gather them to the Battle of that great Day of God Almighty.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Behold I come as a Thief, bleſſed is he that watcheth, and keepeth his Garments, leſt he walk naked, and they ſee his Shame.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>And he gathered them together into a place called in the</hi> Hebrew <hi>Tongue,</hi> Amageddon.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>This Vial</hi> contains a great <hi>variety of matter,</hi> and <hi>Subjects,</hi> to whom it relates, and ſeems to point at <hi>Events,</hi> which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern not only the fall of <hi>Antichriſt,</hi> under the reſtriction we have hitherto been ſpeaking of <hi>him,</hi> but of <hi>all others,</hi> (though not ſo preciſely under that Denomination) <hi>who with him riſe up a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Lord and his Anointed,</hi> Pſal. 2. 2.</p>
               <p>And 'tis but neceſſary we ſhould have this notion of it, the <hi>buſineſs of this Vial</hi> being to uſher in the <hi>Kingdom of Chriſt on Earth,</hi> i. e. To open a way for the <hi>Return of the Jews,</hi> and <hi>the fulneſs of the Gentiles,</hi> which is what <hi>that Kingdom will con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt in;</hi> And if ſo, it cannot be imagined, how there ſhould be any left to oppoſe the <hi>Purity of the Chriſtian Religion,</hi> (which will be the <hi>great Glory</hi> of <hi>our Lords Reign,)</hi> any <hi>of his Enemies</hi> remain, who ſhall not <hi>be deſtroyed.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>That indeed <hi>his Enemies</hi> ſhall be willing to make a puſh for it, to make their <hi>laſt attempt</hi> againſt his Power, is ſcarce to be doubted; for if (as it is in the former <hi>Vial) they repent not after all his Plagues of their Deeds,</hi> what can be expected, but that their <hi>Impenitency will hide the things that belong to their Peace from their Eyes,</hi> and they will uſe all endeavours to aſſert their <hi>unrighteous Cauſe?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>What can be expected, but that they will <hi>band and league together</hi> to oppoſe their <hi>common Enemy?</hi> or if they <hi>band not,</hi> if they enter not into common <hi>Leagues</hi> and <hi>Alliances</hi> to this purpoſe; if they continue ſtill at a diſtance, and Enemies to one another, yet that they will all conſpire in the ſame <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice againſt Chriſt; i. e.</hi> That the <hi>Dragon,</hi> the <hi>Beast,</hi> and <hi>falſe Prophet</hi> will all unite in the <hi>common cauſe of Hell,</hi> and <hi>gather themſelves together to the Battle of that great day of God Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty?</hi> Such is the <hi>precipitate Malice, ſuch the blind Envy, ſuch the unaccountable Deſpair of the Devil,</hi> and his <hi>wicked Inſtruments,</hi> that though they are certain, nothing but <hi>ruin</hi> can be the Conſequence, they cannot deny themſelves the ſatisfaction of the <hi>attempt: Lucifer,</hi> under whom they have liſted, <hi>will</hi>
                  <pb n="114" facs="tcp:44425:81"/> 
                  <hi>aſcend, and be like the moſt high;</hi> will in his boundleſs <hi>Pride</hi> and <hi>Ambition</hi> be aſpiring to <hi>ſet himſelf above God,</hi> although he there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by be but preparing his <hi>own Hell,</hi> and fitting himſelf <hi>for ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luſting Chains of Darkneſs.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But then <hi>Chains</hi> and <hi>Darkneſs</hi> will be their Lot, <hi>Ruin and Deſtruction</hi> will attend all their Enterpriſes, and that in the <hi>Extent, Manner, and Circumſtances</hi> of it, is what is here more particularly to be conſidered.</p>
               <p>Now that I ſhall do in the Method <hi>the Vial</hi> is delivered.</p>
               <p n="1">1. I ſhall conſider what is to be underſtood by the great <hi>River Euphrates, and the water thereof,</hi> and <hi>how that is to be dried up?</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. What by the <hi>way of the Kings of the</hi> Eaſt <hi>to be prepared,</hi> and how the <hi>drying up of the Water of the great River</hi> Euphra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes <hi>will prepare their way?</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. What is to be meant by the <hi>three unclean Spirits like Frogs, coming out of the Mouth of the Dragon, and out of the Mouth of the Beaſt, and out of the Mouth of the falſe Prophet?</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="4">4. Why <hi>Chriſt is</hi> ſaid to <hi>come as a Thief</hi> at this time, and to declare thoſe <hi>Bleſſed that ſhall then Watch?</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="5">5. The turn he ſhall give to Affairs, <hi>in gathering them into a place, called in the Hebrew Tongue,</hi> Amageddon?</p>
               <p n="1">1. What is to be underſtood by the <hi>great River</hi> Euphrates, <hi>and the Water thereof,</hi> and how <hi>that is to be dried up?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Euphrates</hi> may be taken either <hi>literally,</hi> or in a <hi>figurative ſenſe;</hi> either for the <hi>River it ſelf,</hi> and <hi>its Waters,</hi> in the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Notion we have of theſe, or for <hi>thoſe</hi> who are <hi>Borderers on it;</hi> and it is the ſtile the <hi>Holy Ghoſt</hi> makes uſe of, <hi>Rev.</hi> 17. 15. to expreſs <hi>Peoples, Multitudes, Nations, and Tongues, by Waters.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>If in the <hi>firſt ſenſe</hi> we take this, <hi>viz.</hi> For the <hi>River it ſelf, and its Waters,</hi> in the common notion we have of theſe; then <hi>the drying up the Water thereof</hi> under <hi>this Vial,</hi> will be either like what happened in <hi>the drying up the Red-Sea for the Children of</hi> Iſrael <hi>to paſs through it towards</hi> Canaan, or what hath alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy happened to <hi>Euphrates</hi> it ſelf at the taking of <hi>Babylon</hi> by <hi>Cyrus,</hi> who made wide and deep Trenches, whereby to divert it Streams, and ſo came upon that City unawares in the night of their ſolemn Feaſt; the ſame Stratagem by
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:44425:81"/> which <hi>Semiramis</hi> and <hi>Alexander</hi> are likewiſe reported to have taken it, as <hi>Frontinus</hi> relates, <hi>l.</hi> 3. <hi>c.</hi> 7. i. e. This will be, Either</p>
               <p>By Miracle; God immediately interpoſing as he then did, for the deliverance <hi>of his People,</hi> the ſame <hi>People of Iſrael,</hi> as we ſhall afterwards ſhew, for whom he wrought the <hi>for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer Miracle,</hi> and in order to his bringing them into the <hi>ſame Canaan, or Land of Promiſe;</hi> Or</p>
               <p>By <hi>ſome artificial Stratagem,</hi> whereby they ſhall be enabled to open to themſelves a paſſage thorow it.</p>
               <p>But if in the <hi>latter Senſe, Euphrates, and its Waters</hi> are to be taken, <hi>viz. for thoſe who are Borderers on, or Inhabitants near or about it;</hi> Then</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The drying up the Water thereof,</hi> will be, cauſing the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple who thus inhabit, or border on or about it, like the <hi>Sea opening on this, or on that ſide,</hi> no longer <hi>to hinder the paſſage of the ten Tribes</hi> (for it is in all likelihood there the <hi>ten Tribes,</hi> at leaſt, <hi>great part</hi> of them are; nay, whether not mixt among the <hi>Turks themſelves</hi> is very doubtful) <hi>into Canaan,</hi> and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turning to <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> whether in all probability they ſhall be <hi>then gathered.</hi> And this makes way for our ſecond Enquiry, <hi>viz.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. What is to be underſtood by the <hi>way that is to be prepared for the Kings of the</hi> Eaſt, and how the <hi>drying up of the Water of the great River</hi> Euphrates <hi>will prepare their way?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The preparing the way for the Kings of the</hi> Eaſt, <hi>i. e.</hi> For thoſe vaſt Dominions and Countries that lye <hi>Eaſtward,</hi> (for <hi>Kings</hi> come not without their <hi>People,</hi> and <hi>Subjects</hi> to attend them) will ſignifie that great <hi>Acceſſion</hi> ſhall in thoſe parts of the World be there made to <hi>the Goſpel,</hi> by a way being opened for them to embrace it; or if by the <hi>Kings of the East</hi> we underſtand thoſe, who <hi>de jure,</hi> or <hi>of right</hi> are ſuch, <hi>viz. The Seed of Abraham,</hi> or the <hi>Jews, whoſe the Promiſes are,</hi> then will this import (as is already ſaid) a way being made for them through <hi>Euphrates,</hi> in the twofold Senſe we have given of it; to <hi>return into their own Country,</hi> and be there poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſt of that Soveraignty over other Nations, that belongs to them; and being there, without confining their Return to
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:44425:82"/> thoſe who ſhall come <hi>Eaſtward of Euphrates</hi> (for from all parts of the World ſhall they at leaſt ſome of them be ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered to <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> as is otherwhere Propheſied; <hi>Iſaiah</hi> 11. 11, 12, 14, 15, 16. <hi>Ezek.</hi> 37. 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28.) They may be called the <hi>Kings of the Eaſt particularly</hi> (for ſo <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> and <hi>Canaan</hi> are called the <hi>Eaſt,)</hi> becauſe there is to be the chief <hi>Seat of the Empire,</hi> there they to be <hi>again E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtabliſhed.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And it is more than probable it ſhould be ſo, if we conſider the many <hi>Propheſies</hi> which <hi>expreſly foretel it,</hi> and have never yet <hi>been fulfilled</hi> to them. 'Tis impoſſible that there ſhould not be <hi>glorious times behind for the Seed of Abraham,</hi> and as im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible that the <hi>Kings of Eaſt,</hi> (the Nations amongſt which they are ſcattered, thoſe vaſt Dominions and Countries which lye <hi>Eaſtward,</hi> and have hitherto been ſo much in the dark, as to the knowledge of the Goſpel) ſhould not ſhare in <hi>that Glory with them.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And, methinks I cannot but upon this occaſion apply what we read, <hi>Ieremiah</hi> 50. 38. <hi>A drought is upon her Waters, and they ſhall be dried up;</hi> and again, <hi>chap.</hi> 51. 32. <hi>The Paſſages are ſtopt;</hi> it is with reference to <hi>Euphrates,</hi> and the <hi>drying up of its Water,</hi> the Prophet there ſpeaks, when <hi>Babylon</hi> was to be taken by <hi>Cyrus,</hi> as we have already ſhewed, it really happen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; but it we conſider the whole context, and the <hi>gracious expreſſions of God</hi> to his People, beyond what hath ever yet <hi>been verified to them;</hi> ſuch as what occurs, <hi>ch.</hi> 51. 5. <hi>For Iſrael hath not been forſaken, nor Judah of his God, of the Lord of Hosts:</hi> And <hi>ver.</hi> 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24. <hi>The Portion of Iacob is not like them, for he is the former of all things, and</hi> Iſrael <hi>is the Rod of his Inheritance, the Lord of Hoſts his Name.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thou art my Battle-Axe and Weapon of War: For with thee will I break in pieces the Nations, and with thee will I deſtroy Kingdoms.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>And with thee will I break in pieces the Horſe, and his Rider, and with thee will I break in pieces the Chariot, and his Rider.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>With thee alſo will I break in pieces Man and Woman, and with thee will I break in pieces Old and Young, and with thee will I break in pieces the Young-Man and the Maid.</hi>
               </p>
               <pb n="117" facs="tcp:44425:82"/>
               <p>
                  <hi>I will alſo break in pieces with thee, the Shepherd and his Flock, and with thee will I break in pieces the Huſbandman and his Yoke of Oxen, and with thee will I break in pieces Captains and Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>And I will render unto Babylon, and to all the Inhabitants of Chaldea, all their evil that they have done in Zion in your ſight, ſaith the Lord.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And again, ver. 36. <hi>Therefore thus ſaith the Lord, behold I will plead thy Cauſe, and take Vengeance for thee, and I will dry up her Sea, and make her Springs dry.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And before, chap. 50. 4, 5, 6. <hi>In thoſe Days, and in that time, ſaith the Lord, the Children of Irael ſhall come, they and the Children of Judah together, going and Weeping: They ſhall go and ſeek the Lord their God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>They ſhall ask the way to Zion with their Faces thitherward, ſaying, Come and let us join our ſelves to the Lord, in a perpetual Covenant that ſhall not be forgotten.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>My People hath been loſt Sheep, their Shepherds have cauſed them to go aſtray, they have turned them away on the Mountains; they have gone from Mountain to Hill, they have forgotten their reſting place.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And afterwards, <hi>ver.</hi> 17, 18, 19. <hi>Iſrael is a ſcattered Sheep, the Lyons have driven him away: Firſt the King of Aſſyria hath de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured him, and laſt, Nebuchadrezzar King of Babylon hath bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken his Bones.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Therefore thus ſaith the Lord of Hoſts, the God of Iſrael, behold I will puniſh the King of Babylon, and his Land, as I have puniſhed the King of Aſſyria.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>And I will bring Iſrael again to his Habitation, and he ſhall feed on Carmel and Baſhan, and his Soul ſhall be ſatisfied upon Mount Ephraim and Gilead.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>In thoſe days, and in that time, ſaith the Lord, the Iniquity of Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael ſhall be ſought for, and there ſhall be none, and the Sins of Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dah, and they ſhall not be found, for I will pardon them whom I reſerve.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And ver. 33, 34. <hi>Thus ſaith the Lord of Hoſts, the Children of Iſreal, and the Children of Judah were opprest together, and all that took them Captives held them faſt, they refuſed to let them them go.</hi>
               </p>
               <pb n="118" facs="tcp:44425:83"/>
               <p>
                  <hi>Their Redeemer is ſtrong, the Lord of Hoſts is his Name, he ſhall throughly plead their Cauſe, that he may give Reſt to the Land, and diſquiet the Inhabitants of Babylon.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now then, if <hi>Babylon</hi> hath never yet been <hi>ſo fully deſtroyed,</hi> as is here expreſt, as he, who reads theſe two whole Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, will ſee: If <hi>Iſrael</hi> hath never yet been <hi>ſo reſtored</hi> as is there <hi>Propheſied,</hi> it will follow, that what is there promiſed is ſtill to be made good to the <hi>Jews,</hi> and that which is to lead to it, will be (whether in a <hi>literal,</hi> or <hi>Metaphorical Senſe,</hi> or <hi>both,</hi> I leave it to the conſidering Reader to determine) <hi>by the drying up the River</hi> Euphrates, and that for the deſtruction of <hi>Babylon</hi> in its largeſt Extent: Whatever <hi>Babylon</hi> it is, that hath <hi>tyrannized over God's People,</hi> it is to have its <hi>Share in this Vial.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>'Tis true, I ſubmit it, that the <hi>Holy Ghoſt</hi> hath expreſly mentioned the <hi>Medes</hi> in the Judgement to be brought on <hi>Baby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lon,</hi> deſcribed in theſe two Chapters of <hi>Jeremiah,</hi> Jer. 51. 28. But I cannot but think that there is ſomething <hi>typical</hi> as well as <hi>literal,</hi> in the large deſcription there given; and if it be certain, that a great deal of what is ſaid there cannot be applied to the taking of <hi>Babylon</hi> by <hi>Cyrus,</hi> and <hi>the return of the Jews upon his Proclamation,</hi> or any thing that hath ſince happen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to <hi>that Land of graven Images, ch.</hi> 50. 38. It is as certain, that there is <hi>a Day ſtill to come,</hi> when what is <hi>lacking ſhall be fulfilled</hi> upon her, and upon all thoſe, who like her <hi>are mad upon their Idols,</hi> ibid. A <hi>Day too</hi> wherein no one Title of what God hath promiſed to the <hi>Jews,</hi> to <hi>Iſrael and Judah</hi> (as they are ch. 50. 4. and 51. 5. diſtinctly mentioned) ſhall fall to the Ground.</p>
               <p>This, as <hi>to the drying up the Water of the River Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phrates,</hi> with the <hi>end</hi> why 'tis <hi>to be dried up, viz. That the Way of the Kings of the</hi> Eaſt <hi>might be prepared.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Only one thing I ſhall farther offer, and that is, if by <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phrates and the Water</hi> thereof, we underſtand <hi>thoſe</hi> who were the <hi>Borderers on it, the Inhabitants near or about the River,</hi> (of whom more by and by) it will not be neceſſary, that we preciſely tye them up to <hi>that Place,</hi> for the <hi>whole time of the Vial,</hi> no more than it will be neceſſary, that for the aſcertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>the River it ſelf,</hi> we ſuppoſe the <hi>ſame Waters</hi> to <hi>be always</hi>
                  <pb n="119" facs="tcp:44425:83"/> 
                  <hi>there:</hi> No, we know very well, <hi>the Waters</hi> that run <hi>in Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers</hi> are ſtill <hi>in Flux,</hi> that which paſſes the <hi>Channel to Day,</hi> is gone from thence <hi>to Morrow,</hi> and yet it is by all eſteemed the <hi>ſame River</hi> ſtill; <hi>People and Nations</hi> are as much in <hi>Flux,</hi> as <hi>Waters</hi> can be, thoſe that live in <hi>one Country</hi> in <hi>one Age,</hi> in <hi>another Age</hi> may live in <hi>another Country,</hi> but yet ſure they are the <hi>ſame People</hi> ſtill; at leaſt if they <hi>change their Seats,</hi> and remove <hi>their Habitation,</hi> they leave ſtill <hi>their Country behind them,</hi> that abides the <hi>ſame,</hi> whatever becomes of its <hi>flitting Inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The uſe I make of this, is, that if <hi>Euphrates</hi> be taken for the <hi>People</hi> that bordered on it, when the <hi>Holy-Ghost</hi> firſt ſpeaks of them, then wherever this People ſhall be in the whole time of this Vial, <hi>the drying up the Water of</hi> Euphrates may be applied to them: So that if now <hi>the People (the</hi> Turks <hi>are that People,</hi> as we ſhall preſently ſhew) be removed any of them from the <hi>Banks of</hi> Euphrates ('tis but what its <hi>own Waters</hi> of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten do,) wherever they are (for ſo might the <hi>Waters</hi> that run out of <hi>Euphrates,</hi> if they could in all their wandrings be di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinguiſhed from <hi>other Waters,</hi> be ſtill called the <hi>Waters</hi> of <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phrates)</hi> they may ſtill be expreſſed under the <hi>ſame ſtile;</hi> And if ſo, then there will be ſtill a farther notion we may have of <hi>the drying up the Water of the great River</hi> Euphrates, as it may be enlarged to hold out to us the overthrow of the whole <hi>Mahometan Empire;</hi> the removing that Tyrannical Kingdom, which hath ſo long uſurpt upon the World, and oppreſt the <hi>Jews</hi> in particular, hath ſo far extended its Territories, and all to the <hi>Ruin</hi> of the <hi>true Religion; that Religion,</hi> which <hi>under the laſt Vial</hi> is to be <hi>in its Triumph,</hi> and <hi>under this</hi> to have <hi>its way prepared for it.</hi>
               </p>

               </p>
               <p>The Dragon in this <hi>Book of the Revelation</hi> is taken either for that <hi>old Serpent called</hi> the <hi>Devil,</hi> or <hi>Satan,</hi> Rev. 12. 9. Or for the <hi>ſupreme, Secular,</hi> or <hi>temporal Power,</hi> as acting <hi>under him,</hi> Proſecuting the <hi>ſame Miſchief, envenomed with the ſame Malice</hi> againſt <hi>all that is good,</hi> as this <hi>Serpent,</hi> or <hi>Dragon himſelf</hi> is; and the Name under which ſuch act, is that of the <hi>Beaſt,</hi> the name of <hi>Antichriſtian Power,</hi> whilſt both in <hi>Heathen</hi> and <hi>Papal Rome</hi> as is evident by comparing the <hi>firſt,</hi> and <hi>eleventh</hi> verſes of the 13th. <hi>Chapter</hi> of this Book: VVhere we have <hi>two Beaſts,</hi> one <hi>riſing up out of the Sea,</hi> and the <hi>other</hi> coming <hi>up out of the Earth;</hi> the <hi>one</hi> ſaid to have <hi>ſeven Heads, and ten Horns,</hi> ver. 1. The ſame that is expreſly ſaid of the Dragon, <hi>chap.</hi> 12, 13. The other to riſe <hi>only with two Horns</hi> like a Lamb; <hi>to the firſt,</hi> the Dragon is ſaid to have given <hi>his Power, and Seat, and great Authority;</hi> of the other 'tis ſaid, <hi>He ſpake as the Dragon,</hi> both under ſome <hi>relation</hi> to him, but ſo that the firſt (as I ſhall offer the Reaſon for it preſently) hath <hi>his Name</hi> here given him of <hi>the Dragon,</hi> the <hi>other</hi> that of <hi>the Beaſt,</hi> and the <hi>Subject</hi> of their Power is <hi>Antichriſtian Rome</hi> in its largeſt Extent, <hi>bloody and cruel</hi> as <hi>a Dragon.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>For that ſeems to be the reaſon, why <hi>Rev.</hi> 12. 3. He is called <hi>Red,</hi> as if <hi>dyed with the Blood of the Saints. Cruelty</hi> indeed hath been the Character of <hi>Rome</hi> ever ſince it had its Being: <hi>Romulus</hi> firſt Tinctured its VValls with the <hi>Blood of his Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther;</hi> and all the <hi>Increaſes</hi> of it have been by <hi>Spoil and Ruin:</hi> The <hi>Bloody Sword</hi> hath in a manner always been drawn a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt them, and the time can ſcarce be named, wherein they have not been Engaged either in <hi>inteſtine</hi> or <hi>foreign Wars; Blood</hi> hath always <hi>coloured this Dragon,</hi> but his <hi>deepeſt Dye</hi> hath been in the <hi>Blood of the Chriſtians.</hi>
               </p>
               <pb n="121" facs="tcp:44425:84"/>
               <p>It was the ruin of Chriſtianity he laboured for, in its very <hi>Birth,</hi> as is deſcribed <hi>Rev.</hi> 13. 1, 2, 3, 4. and hath not been wanting ever ſince to attempt <hi>upon it,</hi> in all the Methods and Degrees of that <hi>native Cruelty</hi> which is aſcribed <hi>to the Dra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gon.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But then the <hi>difference</hi> is, that whereas <hi>the Beaſt,</hi> as appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cable both <hi>to Imperial, and Papal Rome,</hi> is ſaid to have <hi>ten Horns,</hi> and <hi>upon his Horns ten Crowns,</hi> Rev. 13. 1. The <hi>Dra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gon</hi> is ſaid to have but <hi>ſeven Crowns, and thoſe on his ſeven Heads.</hi> The Reaſon whereof I take to be this; That the <hi>Power of the Dragon</hi> looks backward and forward, <hi>viz.</hi> to the whole duration of <hi>the Roman</hi> Power, under its <hi>ſeven Heads,</hi> or <hi>ſeven forms of Government, viz.</hi> Under <hi>Kings, Conſuls, Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bunes, Decemvirs, Dictators, Emperors, Popes:</hi> That <hi>of the Beaſt</hi> is limited to the time of the <hi>ten Kings,</hi> which were af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards to riſe up upon the <hi>diviſion</hi> of the Empire; at which time that <hi>other Beaſt,</hi> (for ſo the Holy-Ghoſt ſpeaks diſtinctly <hi>of them</hi> in that forementioned Chapter, <hi>viz. Rev.</hi> 13. 1ſt and 11 Verſes) <hi>was to riſe,</hi> and that too to hold of the <hi>Dragon;</hi> for if it be ſaid of <hi>the firſt</hi> of <hi>theſe Beaſts,</hi> that the Dragon gave him <hi>his Power, and his Seat, and great Authority,</hi> verſe 2. (as we juſt now obſerved) 'tis ſaid of the <hi>other</hi> Beaſt, that he ſpake <hi>as the Dragon.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But that the name of <hi>Dragon,</hi> (for ſo I ſuppoſe it to be in this Vial) is here given to the <hi>one</hi> and not to the <hi>other,</hi> I am apt to think may be, from the different Grounds on which they act; the <hi>former Beaſt,</hi> i. e. The Emperor ſtanding upon the <hi>ſame Foundation,</hi> and exerciſing the ſame <hi>ſort of Power,</hi> that the <hi>former Emperors,</hi> or whatever other <hi>his Predeceſſors did,</hi> i. e. what is properly <hi>Civil:</hi> The <hi>other</hi> Beaſt pretending his title <hi>from Religion,</hi> the title he holds under <hi>Chriſt,</hi> as his <hi>immediate Vicar on Earth,</hi> ſaid therefore to have <hi>two Horns, like a Lamb:</hi> And therefore where they come to be diſtinctly ſpoken of, (as I preſume them to be <hi>in this Vial)</hi> the Name <hi>of Dragon,</hi> the <hi>common</hi> Emblem of the whole <hi>Roman Power</hi> is given <hi>to the one,</hi> that of <hi>Beaſt,</hi> (for the <hi>Dragon</hi> he cannot be, properly ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, becauſe at the moſt he is but one of <hi>his ſeven Heads,</hi> a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>d that under another Capacity than the <hi>others are,</hi> as pretend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to hold from Chriſt for other <hi>ends, and purpoſes,</hi> than the
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:44425:85"/> 
                  <hi>other Heads</hi> received their <hi>Power,)</hi> to the <hi>Other.</hi> The <hi>firſt</hi> is the <hi>Beaſt too,</hi> ver. 1. But the Beaſt that was to be, <hi>as it were wounded to Death,</hi> and ever after not <hi>to live</hi> but <hi>in that</hi> Image this <hi>other Beaſt</hi> ſhould give him, <hi>ver.</hi> 15. And therefore more eminently may <hi>this Beaſt</hi> which gave the other <hi>that Life</hi> it hath, be ſtiled <hi>the Beaſt,</hi> as 'tis in the following part of this whole Book of the Revelation. <hi>Diſtinct</hi> indeed they are in all their Actings, and therefore may very well be diſtinctly ſpoken of; the <hi>firſt Beaſt,</hi> i. e. The <hi>Emperor</hi> in the Exerciſe of Civil Power, as he now enjoins it, for his diſtinguiſhing Character be very well remitted to what the <hi>Holy-Ghoſt</hi> makes the <hi>common Stile</hi> of all the <hi>ſeven Heads,</hi> or <hi>forms</hi> of Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in the whole time of the <hi>Roman Power,</hi> i. e. The ſtile of <hi>Dragon;</hi> the <hi>other Beast,</hi> i. e. the <hi>Pope,</hi> for his Uſurpations over the <hi>Civil Powers,</hi> with that <hi>Juriſdiction</hi> he exerciſes over them, as well as others, and that <hi>dependance</hi> they have on him, <hi>more eminently and ſolitarily</hi> be ſaid to be <hi>the Beaſt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>So then by this time it will not be difficult to apprehend, whom we are to underſtand by the <hi>Dragon and the Beaſt:</hi> Not ſo much the <hi>Old Serpent,</hi> the <hi>Devil,</hi> or <hi>Satan himſelf,</hi> as <hi>thoſe</hi> who act <hi>under him.</hi> The <hi>one</hi> the more directly under the Relation of <hi>a Dragon,</hi> as to him he, (the Dragon) ſo expreſly is ſaid to <hi>give his Power; the other</hi> under the ſtile <hi>of Beaſt,</hi> as it is more particularly aſcribed to him, that came <hi>up out of the Earth,</hi> i. e. As is before ſhewed at large, as he was to uſurp upon the <hi>former,</hi> and come up upon the <hi>Ruins of the Empire;</hi> And this <hi>as a Lamb,</hi> though in the Event he ſhould ſhew him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to act as <hi>a Dragon.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Which being granted, the only difficulty will be, whom we are to underſtand by <hi>the falſe Prophet:</hi> Whether the <hi>delu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding Spirit,</hi> by which theſe Acted, thoſe <hi>falſe Teachers, and Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducers,</hi> which act <hi>with,</hi> or <hi>under them;</hi> or ſome other <hi>Perſon,</hi> or <hi>ſtate</hi> of Men diſtinct <hi>from both?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And for my part, I am inclined to think it muſt be ſome third <hi>Perſon or State</hi> diſtinct from the <hi>two other:</hi> For I cannot be of their Opinion, who make the <hi>Dragon, and Beaſt,</hi> and <hi>falſe Prophet</hi> to be <hi>the ſame,</hi> no more than I can the <hi>three un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clean Spirits</hi> which <hi>come out of their Mouths</hi> to be <hi>one;</hi> which being in it ſelf a <hi>Contradiction,</hi> I hope it will not be account<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed <hi>one</hi> to diſtinguiſh <hi>them.</hi>
               </p>
               <pb n="123" facs="tcp:44425:85"/>
               <p>But who then ſhall be this <hi>falſe Prophet?</hi> Who indeed, but he, who hath falſly arrogated it to himſelf? <hi>Mahomet</hi> I mean, who is known to have aſſumed it, and it is always given him <hi>by his Followers,</hi> and that in <hi>preference</hi> to <hi>Chriſt</hi> himſelf, the <hi>great Prophet</hi> of his Church, and he who was promiſed under <hi>that Name, Deuter.</hi> 18. 18.</p>
               <p>Beſides it is a Stile the <hi>Dragon, and Beaſt, Emperor and Pope,</hi> let me now call them, never aſſumed: And I cannot ſee, why this ſhould not be admitted here; if we obſerve either, where the <hi>Vial</hi> is ſaid to be poured out, <hi>viz. on Euphrates,</hi> in which the <hi>Turks</hi> or <hi>Mahometans</hi> are ſo much concerned, (as is at large ſhewed in this Chapter,) and what the work aſſigned to the three <hi>unclean Spirits,</hi> is, <hi>viz. To go forth unto the Kings of the Earth, and of the whole World,</hi> (a larger diſtrict than is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny where given to the <hi>Roman Empire</hi> alone) <hi>to gather them to the Battle of that great Day of God Almighty.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>'Tis true indeed, that the falſe Prophet afterwards, <hi>viz. Revel.</hi> 19. 20. and <hi>Revel.</hi> 20. 10. is a ſtile under which <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tichriſt</hi> is expreſſed, but then 'tis to <hi>diſtinguiſh him from the Beaſt,</hi> not to make him the <hi>ſame with him;</hi> as alſo to ſhew how it was <hi>the Beaſt,</hi> or <hi>Roman Empire,</hi> was deceived <hi>by him,</hi> as he was <hi>a falſe Prophet</hi> in the <hi>Doctrines he</hi> taught, and the <hi>Miracles</hi> whereby <hi>he</hi> pretended to confirm <hi>the ſame;</hi> and what was the conſequence thereof, that the <hi>Deceiver</hi> and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived were to periſh together.</p>
               <p>Indeed I can ſcarce forbear to conjecture at leaſt, that <hi>this Vial</hi> looks farther than is yet expreſt; for when we have gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven the utmoſt Extent we can to the <hi>Roman,</hi> and <hi>Mahometan Empires,</hi> they will come very much ſhort of what is ſet down here, I mean <hi>the Kings of the Earth, and the whole World;</hi> which is of too wide a compaſs to be contained in either of the former: Only the <hi>Dragon,</hi> the <hi>old Serpent,</hi> or <hi>Satan</hi> who is called <hi>the God of this World,</hi> (and is moſt properly ſo, in thoſe places, where their Juriſdictions do not reach, for it is there to this day the <hi>Devil</hi> is profeſſedly Worſhipped, at leaſt he is ſo, in ſome parts of the <hi>Pagan</hi> VVorld,) in the extent of <hi>his Territories</hi> will take in the <hi>whole.</hi> And I would be willing to hope that the Day is coming when there ſhall be an end put to <hi>ſuch his Uſurpations;</hi> I would hope at the <hi>end of this Vial</hi> to ſee <hi>the Jews in their Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn,</hi>
                  <pb n="124" facs="tcp:44425:86"/> and the <hi>fulneſs of the</hi> Gentiles <hi>coming in:</hi> I would hope to ſee, (it is an Event methinks, but agreeable <hi>to the Battle of that great Day of God Almighty) our Lord taking to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf his great Power, and Reigning,</hi> Rev. 11. 17. Or as it is <hi>Pſal.</hi> 2. 8. 9. Aſſerting to himſelf <hi>the Heathen for his Inheritance, and the uttermost parts of the Earth for his Poſſeſſion, breaking them with a Rod of Iron, and daſhing them in pieces like a Pot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters Veſſel.</hi> And that ſuch a time ſeems to be at hand will, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear, by that time we ſhall have gone though <hi>this Vial.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This as to the firſt of theſe Queſtions, <hi>viz.</hi> VVhat we are to underſtand by the <hi>Dragon, Beaſt,</hi> and <hi>falſe Prophet?</hi> The ſecond is,</p>
               <p n="2">2. VVhat by the <hi>three unclean Spirits?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>If by the <hi>Dragon, Beaſt,</hi> and <hi>falſe Prophet</hi> we underſtand <hi>three diſtinct Perſons,</hi> or <hi>States of Men,</hi> as before explained. then the <hi>three Spirits</hi> will be nothing elſe but either ſo many <hi>diſtinct Powers,</hi> or <hi>Principles</hi> by which they are acted in their oppoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to <hi>Chriſt and his Church;</hi> or ſo many <hi>great Inſtruments, Meſſengers, Miſſionaries,</hi> or whatever other Name we give them, by which they <hi>execute their Decrees,</hi> and any way car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried on the <hi>ſaid Oppoſition.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Nor will the notion of theſe <hi>Spirits either acting the Dragon, Beaſt,</hi> and <hi>falſe Prophet</hi> themſelves, or <hi>ſent out by them,</hi> be dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent, if as ſome do, we underſtand them all of <hi>Antichriſt,</hi> properly ſo called, as limited to the <hi>Romiſh Oeconomy.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And it may be worth enquiring whether with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect to a threefold ſort, either of <hi>Decrees,</hi> or <hi>Orders of Men,</hi> by which he <hi>propagates his wicked Cauſe;</hi> the <hi>Canon Law,</hi> the <hi>later Councils,</hi> (ſuch particularly as that of <hi>Trent,)</hi> and the Colledge ſet up; <hi>de propaganda fide</hi> on one Hand the <hi>Jeſuits, Mendicant Fryers,</hi> (thoſe wandring Saints among them,) and Secular Prieſts on the other, may not make up the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber?</p>
               <p>For here I am ſure, to go no further, we ſhall find <hi>unclean Spirits</hi> with a witneſs: Such is not only the Corruption of <hi>the Doctrines</hi> they propagate, but of <hi>the Lives</hi> of them that propagate them; ſuch their <hi>Impurities</hi> of all ſorts, that we need but mention <hi>their Names,</hi> and their <hi>Perſons, and Practices</hi> will confirm all we can imagine in this Matter.</p>
               <pb n="125" facs="tcp:44425:86"/>
               <p>VVhat <hi>they are,</hi> and how <hi>they Act,</hi> the VVorld is too much a Judge of.</p>
               <p>Nor is it to be admired, of which ſoever of theſe we un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand it, that the parallel the Holy Ghoſt hath found for them, is <hi>that of Frogs.</hi> And</p>
               <p n="3">3. VVhy <hi>they are compared to theſe,</hi> is now to be enquired.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Frogs,</hi> we know, are <hi>amphibious Creatures,</hi> that delight in <hi>Filth</hi> and <hi>Slime;</hi> and <hi>Naturaliſts</hi> tell us that many times they are immediately engendred <hi>out of theſe,</hi> without the help of any other Parent; but where their <hi>cleanlieſt Production</hi> is, 'tis by <hi>ſpawn</hi> caſt on the ſides of the moſt <hi>miry and offenſive Waters:</hi> Their <hi>nature</hi> is <hi>exceedingly to increaſe and multiply;</hi> they love to be creeping abroad in the <hi>dark,</hi> and then <hi>croak</hi> moſt. But after all their <hi>croaking and multitudes,</hi> they are one of the moſt <hi>feeble and deſpicable creatures;</hi> have nothing but their <hi>noiſe</hi> to affright with, being trod down with every foot, and ſoon loſt in the <hi>ſlime and filth</hi> they delight in.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Clear Day,</hi> and <hi>Clear Waters</hi> they moſt avoid; what may either <hi>ſhew or cleanſe</hi> them, is their greateſt Enemy.</p>
               <p>And what now could have better ſuited theſe <hi>unclean Spirits,</hi> of which we have been ſpeaking? And that whether we un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand them in the <hi>first</hi> or <hi>latter ſenſe,</hi> as relating to the <hi>Emperour, Pope,</hi> and <hi>Turk,</hi> as they are differently acted by them; or, as relating to the <hi>Romiſh Corruptions,</hi> and ſo belong only to the <hi>two former?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>For what is it but <hi>filth</hi> and <hi>ſlime</hi> they all delight in? What <hi>their Impurities</hi> of <hi>Life</hi> and <hi>Doctrine?</hi> What the <hi>Corruption of Manners</hi> is in the <hi>Romiſh Church,</hi> hath been already touch'd, and is too <hi>notorious</hi> to want any large deſcant on it; what 'tis among the <hi>Mahometans,</hi> whoſe <hi>Religion</hi> is made only to ſerve their <hi>carnal appetite, their pride, ambition, cruelty, luſt,</hi> and the like, the liberty they give <hi>to theſe</hi> here, and <hi>the ſenſual Paradiſe</hi> they are taught to expect hereafter, is but too ſenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble a demonſtration of.</p>
               <p>And to follow the Metaphor yet farther, 'tis <hi>ſlime and filth</hi> they riſe out of, <hi>troubled and fouled Waters</hi> that produce them; ſuch are <hi>Ignorance and Errors, Sin and Vice</hi> of all ſort, abetted under the falſe pretences of <hi>Truth and Piety.</hi> 'Tis only in ſuch <hi>corrupted ſtreams</hi> that they <hi>ſpawn and multiply;</hi> only un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der

How eaſily ſtampt into <hi>the mire,</hi> and left only as <hi>noiſome ſlime and filth</hi> to be deteſted and avoided by all that paſs by ſuch are the <hi>unclean Spirits</hi> here ſpoken of, ſuch theſe Frogs <hi>coming out of the mouth,</hi> (a Conception worthy ſuch Parents, ſuch breath to inſpire them!) of the <hi>Dragon,</hi> the <hi>Beaſt,</hi> and the <hi>falſe Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet,</hi> and</p>
               <p n="4">4. Why ſaid to come out <hi>of their mouths,</hi> is our next queſtion?

               <p n="1">1.

               <p>Now for this can we have a <hi>better Guide</hi> than the <hi>Holy Ghoſt</hi> himſelf? Let us ſee therefore what he hath ſaid in this mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.</p>
               <p>We have it, <hi>Rev.</hi> 9. 13, 14. <hi>And I heard a Voice from the four Horns of the Golden Altar, which is before God, ſaying to the</hi>

                  <hi>ſixth Angel which had the Trumpet, looſe the four Angels which are bound in the great River</hi> Euphrates.</p>
               <p>What was the <hi>binding of the Angels?</hi> But that ſtop <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence</hi> was pleaſed, for the time appointed, to put to their Acting, what before they were looſe, or free to?</p>
               <p>What <hi>their being looſed,</hi> but the ſame Providences permit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting them to Proſecute their <hi>former deſigns, the taking</hi> off that <hi>check and reſtraint</hi> the ſame wiſe Providence had laid on them?</p>
               <p>Now when was it they were <hi>thus bound,</hi> when was it they were to be <hi>thus looſed?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But to this we muſt premiſe another Queſtion, <hi>viz.</hi> Who theſe <hi>four Angels were?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>To this the Context muſt give us Light, and that it will, if we conſider of whom the <hi>Holy Ghoſt</hi> had been ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing: Now <hi>thoſe</hi> the <hi>Holy-Ghoſt</hi> had been ſpeaking of, are ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally agreed to be the <hi>Saracens,</hi> or <hi>Turks:</hi> For <hi>they</hi> were <hi>thoſe Locuſts,</hi> as they are called <hi>ver.</hi> 3. <hi>which came up out of the Smoak,</hi> to <hi>whom was given Power, as the Scorpions of the Earth have Power,</hi> and who are ſaid, <hi>ver.</hi> 11. <hi>To have a King over them, which is the Angel of the bottomleſs pit, whoſe name in the Hebrew Tongue is</hi> Abaddon, <hi>but in the Greek Tongue hath his name</hi> A polly on, i. e. <hi>A Deſtroyer;</hi> I may ſay too in the <hi>Arabick,</hi> for both <hi>Saracen</hi> and <hi>Turk</hi> in their Original are derived from Verbs, which among other ſignifications have that of <hi>to ſpoil, or deſtroy;</hi> according to which, <hi>John Baptiſt a Egnatius</hi> ſpeaking of the Origin of the <hi>Turks,</hi> ſaith, <hi>Vagi diſpalatique quove cuique ſors affuit, latrocinantes magis quam belligerantes, pro vincias va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtarunt. Wandring, and ſtraggling about as every ones chance was, they waſted Countries more like Robbers than Warriors.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Indeed <hi>both theſe Names</hi> are but the ſame, and by an uſual change in the Oriental Languages of <hi>Shin into Tau,</hi> they ſeem to have but one Original, (but this by the by.)</p>
               <p>They might be ſaid to <hi>come up out of the Smoak,</hi> as it was by their <hi>Alcoran,</hi> and the <hi>groſs Errors</hi> therein broached, the <hi>Mists, and Vapours exhaled out of the bottomleſs</hi> Pit, i. e.

               <pb n="135" facs="tcp:44425:91"/>
               <p>That they are ſaid to <hi>be Locuſts,</hi> may be, as for <hi>their Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers, and the Country</hi> from whence <hi>Mahomet ſprang, viz.

               <p>
                  <hi>That they are commanded not to hurt the Graſs of the Earth, neither any green thing, neither any Tree, but only thoſe Men which have not the Seal of God in their Foreheads,</hi> ſhew, that <hi>they</hi> are not <hi>natural Locuſts,</hi> but ſuch who <hi>liko Locuſts</hi> ſhall make <hi>ſpoil, and havock</hi> of <hi>thoſe,</hi> who are hereby ſignified.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>That they are ſaid to have power given to them, as the Scorpions of the Earth have Power,</hi> muſt relate to the <hi>manner</hi> in which by their firſt coming into <hi>Europe,</hi> they plagued thoſe, againſt whom they had <hi>their Commiſſion;</hi> which was not <hi>to Kill,</hi> but only <hi>torment</hi> for the time there aſſigned, <hi>i. e. for five Months,</hi> the time which <hi>Locuſts</hi> uſually make their ſtay, or 150 <hi>Years</hi> ſignified by thoſe 5 <hi>Months;</hi> as a day in the <hi>Prophetic stile,</hi> is taken for <hi>a Year,</hi> and <hi>de facto</hi> it happened, and hath been al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready toucht on in our Chapter <hi>of the firſt Vial.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>That they are ſaid to <hi>have a King over them, which is the Angel of the bottomleſs pit, whoſe name in the Hebrew Tongue is</hi> Abaddon, <hi>but in the Greek Tongue hath his name</hi> Apollyon, <hi>ver.</hi> 11. Is a manifeſt Declaration, as under <hi>whom</hi> he acts, <hi>i. e. Him,</hi> whoſe place of Reſidence is <hi>the bottomleſs pit,</hi> or <hi>Hell;</hi> ('tis his Meſſage and Errand he is ſent on, though by the Permiſſion of the divine Providence,) ſo what <hi>the Meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage is</hi> for which <hi>this Angel,</hi> or <hi>Meſſenger</hi> is diſpatched thence; <hi>viz.</hi> 'Tis to <hi>deſtroy, and waſte thoſe perſons,</hi> and <hi>Countries</hi> to <hi>whom</hi> he is ſent: Be it <hi>Hebrew,</hi> or <hi>Greek,</hi> in which he hath his Name, this is his <hi>Buſineſs,</hi> this his <hi>profeſſion, to be a Deſtroyer:</hi> He pretends to be deſcended from <hi>Abraham and Sarah,</hi> and claims the promiſe of all Kingdoms for his Followers, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the <hi>only true Believers,</hi> (to <hi>Muſtliman</hi> imports,) and avows <hi>the proſecuting all with War, who obſerve not the Rules of his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion.</hi> Elmachin. Hiſtor. Sarac. p. 3.</p>
               <p>So then granting <hi>the Saracens,</hi> or <hi>Turks</hi> to be <hi>thoſe</hi> the <hi>Holy Ghoſt</hi> there points to, how come they to be called <hi>the four An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels,</hi> ſeeing they were all of the ſame <hi>Original, and Religion?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now this will be cleared by conſidering, <hi>what time</hi> the <hi>Holy Ghoſt</hi> may here be ſuppoſed to aim at, which muſt be <hi>that,</hi> wherein they are ſaid <hi>to be bound;</hi> (for looſing them can have no relation, but to their being bound.) and</p>
               <pb n="136" facs="tcp:44425:92"/>
               <p>That ſeems to be about the end of the eleventh Centu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, when they were driven back by the <hi>Romans</hi> towards <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phrates,</hi> the <hi>place</hi> where they were ſaid to be Bound.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Paulus Jovius</hi> relates it to have happened under <hi>Soliman</hi> their Captain, in the time of <hi>Godfrey of Bulloign;</hi> about which time they divided into <hi>four Tetrarchies, Dynaſties,</hi> or <hi>Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,</hi> viz.

               </p>
               <p>'Tis true indeed, that this diviſion of <hi>Sultanies,</hi> or <hi>diſtinct Governments</hi> laſted not till <hi>the time,</hi> they are ſaid to be <hi>let looſe;</hi> but that no way hinders, why they, being the <hi>ſame People,</hi> under <hi>whatever Government</hi> they ſhould be called back again to ſerve the Purpoſes of <hi>Divine Povidence,</hi> ſhould be called by the <hi>ſame Names,</hi> or notified under the <hi>ſame diſtinction,</hi> that was then a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt them, when they were firſt ſaid to <hi>be bound in the great River</hi> Euphrates.

               <p>And by this time we are able in ſome meaſure to judge, when this Vial was to begin, <hi>viz.</hi> When the <hi>four Angels</hi> (whom I have ſhewed to be meant of the <hi>Turks)</hi> that <hi>were bound in the River</hi> Euphrates <hi>were looſed,</hi> which we have placed <hi>Anno</hi> 1453.</p>

               </p>
               <p>Which I take the more notice of, that if the expiring of the 1260 Years for the <hi>Reign of Antichriſt,</hi> ſhould appear to be <hi>at or near the end</hi> of the <hi>ſixth Vial,</hi> the <hi>ſeventh</hi> being ſtill to be <hi>poured out,</hi> ſhould not put us to a <hi>long expectation</hi> of having it fulfilled: <hi>Chriſt comes as a Thief, to gather them together,</hi> viz. all his Enemies into a <hi>Place called in the Hebrew Tongue, Armageddon;</hi> being there, what ſhould hinder but that (like the executing the Sentence upon the <hi>Conviction, and Judgment</hi> given on the Offender) the <hi>utter exciſion of them ſhould forthwith</hi> Succeed?</p>
               <p>And the <hi>ſeventh Trumpet,</hi> with which I take <hi>this Vial</hi> to ſyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cronize, ſeems to ſpeak the ſame. For if with reſpect <hi>to that</hi> it is ſaid, that the <hi>Myſtery of God ſhould be finiſhed,</hi> which he had <hi>graciouſly declared,</hi>

               <p>And that <hi>theſe ſyncronize,</hi> i. e. fall in together, and are to be fulfilled at the ſame time, will not <hi>the manner</hi> in which they are expreſt, farther inſtruct us? Thus if in <hi>this Vial</hi> it is ſaid, <hi>There came a great Voice out of the Temple of Heaven, from the Throne;</hi> it is ſaid in <hi>the other, the Temple of God was opened in Heaven, and there was ſeen in his Temple, the Ark of his Covenant,</hi>
                  <pb n="139" facs="tcp:44425:93"/> both, as to ſignifie from <hi>whence they came,</hi> for it is added <hi>in the one, And there were Lightnings, and Voices, and Thunderings, and an Earthquake, and great Hail;</hi> in the <hi>other, And there were Voices and Thunderings, and Lightnings,</hi> and there <hi>was a great Earthquake,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>And there fell upon Men a great Hail,</hi> &amp;c. So that it is the ſame thing <hi>they</hi> in the main aim at; the chief difference there ſeems to be, is, that in the one it is ſaid the <hi>Temple of God was opened in Heaven,</hi> which in the other is expreſt only by a great Voice coming thence, without reſtraining its opening to the time of the Vial; but then is not that ſupplied by what weread, <hi>Rev.</hi> 15. 8. where 'tis ſaid, <hi>And the Temple was filled with Smoak from the Glory of God, and from his Power, and no Man was able to enter into the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, till the ſeven Plagues of the ſeven Angels were fulfilled:</hi> If none were able to enter in till then, then certainly it was not open till then: <hi>i. e.</hi> Opened it was in neither in the Senſe I give of it, as relating to the <hi>free publication of the Goſpel,</hi> i. e. The <hi>Word of</hi> God, or <hi>his Teſtament</hi> which in the times of Antichriſt was lockt up, but now to <hi>be ſeen, and peruſed</hi> of all.</p>
               <p>And to <hi>this Opening of the Temple,</hi> ſeems to agree, what we have <hi>Rev.</hi> 11. 1. Where St. <hi>Iohn</hi> is bid <hi>to riſe and meaſure the Temple of God, but to leave out the Court which is without the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, and meaſure it not, for it is given unto the</hi> Gentiles, <hi>who ſhould tread down the holy City for forty two Months.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Meaſuring</hi> is the ſetting certain bounds to any thing, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly what <hi>Iohn</hi> is bid to do, may be underſtood of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite, and certain Bounds ſet to the <hi>Church in its Purity,</hi> ſo that it was not to appear as <hi>ſuch</hi> again, till the Interval that was to Intervene, ſhould expire, <hi>viz. the</hi> 42 <hi>Months</hi> there ſpoken of; that being expired, the Limits and Boundaries ſo ſet, are again removed, <hi>i. e. The Temple is again opened, Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion in its purity profeſſed, the Ark of the Teſtament ſeen in the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,</hi> the <hi>Law</hi> which was depoſited there (ſo it was com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded, <hi>Exod.</hi> 25. 16. 21.) publiſhed, and to be obeyed by all.</p>
               <p>And its being poured into the <hi>Air,</hi> methinks very plainly ſpeaks this to us, for what is the <hi>Air,</hi> but the <hi>whole Medium, or Vehicle of Light,</hi> and ſo may denote all who are capable of being enlightned by the Truth, to be the ſubjects of that clearer, or <hi>more univerſal Revelation,</hi> which is now to be made of it.</p>

               <p>And is it any wonder, when this ſhall be, <hi>that a great Earthquake ſhould follow:</hi> ſaith the Text, it ſhall <hi>be ſuch as was not ſince Men were upon the Earth, ſo mighty an Earthquake, and ſo great.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>An <hi>Earthquake,</hi> we know <hi>ſhakes and unſettles all; Houſes, Villages, Towns, Cities, Hills, Valleys, Forreſts, whole Countries,</hi> with the <hi>Inhabitants</hi> have felt the Effects thereof: <hi>This</hi> is to
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:44425:94"/> be <hi>ſuch an Earthquake, ſo mighty, and ſo great, as was not ſince Men were upon Earth.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I will not ſay it is to be a <hi>meer natural Earthquake,</hi> though ſuch often have been obſerved to forerun, or <hi>accompany great Iudgments,</hi> and I am apt to think this ſort of <hi>Earthquakes</hi> may uſher <hi>in or accompany this Vial;</hi> there <hi>have great, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary things of that nature happened</hi> in our own times!</p>
               <p>But to ſuch <hi>prodigious Events only,</hi> I do not imagine this to be confined, but rather I believe it to direct to ſomething like what God ſpeaks by his Prophet. <hi>Haggai</hi> 2. 6, 7. <hi>Yet once it is a little while, and I will ſhake the Heavens and the Earth, and the Sea, and dry Land, and I will ſhake all Nations;</hi> which St. <hi>Paul</hi> thus refers to, <hi>Heb.</hi> 12. 26, 27. <hi>whoſe Voice then ſhook the Earth</hi> (he ſpeaks of the <hi>Earthquake</hi> that accompanied <hi>the giving of the Law of</hi> Moſes,) <hi>but now he hath promiſed, ſaying, Yet once more I ſhall ſhake not the Earth only, but alſo Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, and this Word yet once more ſignifieth the removing of thoſe things that are ſhaken.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The buſineſs of this <hi>Earthquake</hi> will be utterly to remove what in the times of <hi>Antichriſt</hi> prevailed, quite to change <hi>the whole Face of things,</hi> and bring in that <hi>Evangelical State,</hi> which, to follow the Apoſtles Expreſſion in the next verſe, will <hi>be a Kingdom which cannot be moved.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Would we ſee what were to be the <hi>effects of this Earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quake?</hi> It follows <hi>v.</hi> 19, 20. <hi>And the great City was divided into three parts, and the Cities of the Nations fell, and great</hi> Baby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lon <hi>came in remembrance before God, to give unto her the Cup of the Wine of the fierceneſs of his Wrath.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And <hi>every Iſland fled away, and the Mountains were not found.</hi> The <hi>great City</hi> what it is, is ſufficiently deſcribed in the next Chapter,, <hi>ver.</hi> 18. where it is ſaid, <hi>and the Woman which thou ſaweſt, is the great City which Reigneth over the Kings of the Earth.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>'Tis <hi>Rome</hi> that in that <hi>Chapter</hi> is, 1. repreſented under the <hi>Figure of a Woman,</hi> and that, as with reſpect to the <hi>ſeveral ſucceſſions of Government in the Roman Empire,</hi> ſo too with <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect to the great Corruptions in the Church,</hi> which was to be ſeated in it. 2. Her <hi>Cruelties</hi> likewiſe are there ſet forth as <hi>under the emblem of a ſcarlet-coloured Beaſt,</hi> ver. 3. <hi>So by her</hi>
                  <pb n="142" facs="tcp:44425:95"/> 
                  <hi>being drunken with the Blood of the Saints of the Martyrs of Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus,</hi> ver. 6. And 3. How ſhe is ſaid to come to her End: <hi>ver.</hi> 16. viz. By thoſe <hi>very Horns, or ten Kings (who had given their Power and Strength to her,</hi> ver. 13.) <hi>Hating her, and making her deſolate, and naked, and eating her Fleſh, and burning her with Fire.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>So then the <hi>great City</hi> here ſpoken of, <hi>is Rome,</hi> as ſhe Reign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth over <hi>the Kings of the Earth,</hi> not <hi>Rome</hi> as confined within the <hi>Walls of the City,</hi> which bears that <hi>name,</hi> but as ſhe ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends <hi>her Territories</hi> as far as the <hi>Roman Empire,</hi> or as it is now changed into <hi>Papal,</hi> reaches.</p>
               <p>And as <hi>to the dividing this City into three</hi> parts, I ſhall offer theſe two Conjectures; the firſt is Monſieur <hi>Jurieu's,</hi> (whoſe <hi>Learning, Piety, and Zeal,</hi> I extreamly reverence,) and it is this, <hi>viz.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q rend="inline">That upon the <hi>Preaching of the Reformers,</hi> the <hi>Antichristian Empire</hi> was divided into three Parts: one part remained to Antichriſt himſelf, one ſepaated from him under the name of the Confeſſion of <hi>Ausburgh;</hi> the third under the <hi>Confeſſion</hi> of them who are ſimply called the <hi>Reformed.</hi>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q rend="inline">
                     <hi>Sueden, Denmark,</hi> and a great part of <hi>Germany</hi> make the 2d Part <hi>England,</hi> the united Provinces, the <hi>Reformed in France,</hi> the <hi>Suiſſes, and port of Germany</hi> make the third.</q> Here, ſaith he, are the three great Parts which divide the <hi>Weſtern Church,</hi> which is <hi>the great City.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The ſecond Conjecture I have to offer in this matter, is the <hi>Diviſion of it,</hi> as it is <hi>that City which reigneth over the Kings of the Earth;</hi> And that is, as <hi>at preſent,</hi> and ſince <hi>the Reformation</hi> there have been theſe <hi>three diſtinct Parts of this great City.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The <hi>firſt</hi> of ſuch <hi>Kings, or Kingdoms</hi> that have wholly <hi>fallen from</hi> her, ſuch are all who profeſs the <hi>Proteſtant Religion.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly, of <hi>ſuch,</hi> which however they have not left <hi>her Communion,</hi> yet have caſt off <hi>her Supremacy,</hi> and <hi>Infallibility,</hi> i. e. As the diſtinction is ſince taken up, are of the <hi>Church,</hi> tho' not of the <hi>Court of Rome.</hi> This I ſuppoſe to be verified, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever the <hi>Council of Trent</hi> (by which <hi>Rome</hi> ſubſiſts) is not received, and where the <hi>Regalia, Inveſtitures,</hi> &amp;c. are diſputed, and where too theſe, or <hi>any other</hi> the <hi>Arcana Imperii,</hi> the <hi>ſecret Grounds and Foundations,</hi> by which the <hi>Papacy</hi> upholds it ſelf,
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:44425:95"/> have been proſeſſedly diſputed, contradicted, and by the <hi>pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Decrees of their Univerſities, or otherwiſe declared againſt, or reſcinded:</hi> And then</p>
               <p>Thirdly <hi>of ſuch,</hi> as ſtill continue <hi>in their Obedience to her.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>What follows, And the <hi>Cities of the Nations</hi> fell. I take to be, but the Conſequence of the former; for if the <hi>great City</hi> be <hi>Rome</hi> in the extent of her <hi>Empire or Government, leſſer Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties</hi> will import <hi>leſſer Governments,</hi> and their falling with <hi>reſpect to Rome,</hi> muſt be a falling <hi>from her Laws,</hi> in being no longer governed by <hi>the Papal Decrees,</hi> the <hi>Canon Law,</hi> or whatever elſe ſhe Rules by; but by their <hi>own Models</hi> both for their <hi>Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil and Religious</hi> Government.</p>
               <p>But if ſtill we would have ſomething more particular here, why may not the <hi>united Provinces,</hi> and <hi>Hans Towns in Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>many</hi> afford us a Comment on it! <hi>Sed monum de Tabulà.</hi> 'Tis added,</p>
               <p>And <hi>great</hi> Babylon <hi>came in remembrance before God, to give unto her the Cup of the Wine of the fierceneſs of his Wrath.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And every Iſland fled away, and the <hi>Mountains were not found.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This ſeems to be the great <hi>Catastrophe</hi> of all, every thing elſe is but <hi>preparatory,</hi> this the <hi>conſummating of the Judgment of the great Whore.</hi> And may ſhe ſoon <hi>have this Cup to drink,</hi> I perſwade my ſelf it is not far off.</p>
               <p>What <hi>the Cup is,</hi> is more expreſly ſet down, <hi>chap.</hi> 18. 2. 8. <hi>Babylon the Great is fallen, is fallen, and is become the Habitation of Devils, and the hold of every foul Spirit, and a Cage of every unclean and hateful Bird;</hi> this was <hi>her Sin,</hi> this is <hi>her Doom!</hi> Therefore <hi>ſhall her Plagues come in one day, Death, and Mourn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and Famine, and ſhe ſhall be utterly burnt with Fire: For ſtrong is the Lord God who Judgeth her.</hi> When it comes to paſs, it will explain it ſelf; nor ſhall I therefore add any thing far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther on it:</p>
               <p>Only what is to be meant <hi>by every Iſland flying away, and the Mountains not being found,</hi> which is yet behind to be ſpoken to, would be known.</p>
               <p>And for that, I content my ſelf, with applying the notion <hi>of Iſlands</hi> to thoſe numerous <hi>Monasteries,</hi> and <hi>Convents,</hi> and <hi>Religious Houſes</hi> of any ſort among them. For what is an <hi>Iſland,</hi> but a <hi>part of the Earth environed by the Waters,</hi> and
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:44425:96"/> 
                  <hi>having no Commerce, or Union</hi> with <hi>the Continent?</hi> And are not ſuch <hi>Houſes and Places,</hi> with reſpect to the ſeveral <hi>Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries</hi> in which they are, divided as it were <hi>from the Earth?</hi> Do they not ſubſiſt by <hi>Laws and Constitutions</hi> of their own? Do they not pretend to be <hi>ſequeſtred from the reſt of the World?</hi> To have no converſe in Worldly Affairs, but to be <hi>wholly ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated</hi> to obſerve the Rules of their ſeveral Orders? Theſe to me are <hi>the Iſlands here ſpoken of; Iſlands</hi> in reſpect to their diſtinct Governments, in the ſame Senſe, <hi>that the great City,</hi> is the <hi>whole Roman,</hi> or <hi>Papal Empire.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And as for what we are to conſtrue theſe <hi>Mountains</hi> of, I can ſee nothing more proper to anſwer this Alluſion, than the <hi>great and eminent</hi> Men among them, (who in Scripture are ſo often expreſt by <hi>Hills or Mountains,</hi> as <hi>Men of low Eſtate</hi> are by <hi>the Valleys)</hi> ſuch are their <hi>Biſhops, Archbiſhops, Cardinals, Abbots, Priors, Generals</hi> of their ſeveral Orders, and higheſt of all, the <hi>Pope himſelf, and his Legates.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now the <hi>flying away of the one,</hi> and <hi>the others not being found;</hi> ſignifies the <hi>ſudden Deſtruction and Confuſion,</hi> that will over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take them all in that day; when all <hi>States,</hi> and <hi>Orders,</hi> their <hi>whole Hierarchy</hi> with all its <hi>Dependants,</hi> ſhall at once Vaniſh: And ſuch a Storm follow <hi>them</hi> that adhere to them, expreſt by <hi>Men,</hi> i. e. Men of ordinary rank and ſtation, <hi>the Laity of that Religion,</hi> ſuch <hi>Hail out of Heaven fall upon them,</hi> as it were by the immediate Hand of God <hi>bringing theſe Judgments</hi> on them, <hi>that wicked and impeniteut Wretches</hi> as they are, (for otherwiſe they would have taken the Warning, and <hi>come out of</hi> Babylon, as it is, <hi>ch.</hi> 18. 4. would not have been <hi>Partakers of her</hi> Sins, that they might not have <hi>received of her Plagues,)</hi> but <hi>curſed Wretches</hi> as they are, ſtill to adhere to her in <hi>her Abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minations,</hi> nothing but <hi>Blaſphemy is left them;</hi> they <hi>Blaſphemed God</hi> in the prophane uſe of his name all the time of their Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtacy, they now without <hi>looking up to that Heaven,</hi> from whence <hi>theſe Plagues</hi> come, Blaſpheme him <hi>becauſe of the plague of the Hail,</hi> and ſhall be given up to <hi>Eternal Blaſphemy,</hi> bitter <hi>Execrations and Curſings</hi> (the lot <hi>of the Damned)</hi> and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>Curſed</hi> for Ever.</p>
               <pb n="145" facs="tcp:44425:96"/>
               <p>But when this ſhall be, will be ſtill the great Enquiry, and what to anſwer to it is difficult; for as Chriſt ſpeaks, when the Elders of the People, and the chief Prieſts, and the Scribes asked him, <hi>Art thou the Chriſt?</hi> If I tell you, ſhall I ſay, I ſay it not; but if God, if Chriſt, if the Holy-Ghoſt ſhould tell you, you will not Believe, <hi>Luke</hi> 22. 67. For it is God, it is Chriſt, it is the Holy-Ghoſt who have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready told it; it is declared with all the certainty that a My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtery can be declared, in this Book of the <hi>Revelation:</hi> The Riſe, the Progreſs, the Downfal of Antichriſt is foretold, and yet forſooth we muſt be tender in the Point, and not ſo much as dare to <hi>ſay, that Antichriſt is come, who,</hi> or <hi>what he is,</hi> and <hi>where is his Seat:</hi> The Angel may tell <hi>John, Rev.</hi> 17. 7. &amp;c: <hi>the myſtery of the Woman, and the Beaſt that carrieth her, which hath the ſeven Heads, and ten Horns,</hi> may ſhew the place from whence <hi>he cometh, and whither he goeth, ver.</hi> 8. With all the parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularities of his Reign; may ſhew what the <hi>ſeven Heads,</hi> and <hi>ten Horns are, when,</hi> and <hi>where to ariſe,</hi> ver. 9. 11, 12.

And leſt after all, any miſtake ſhould be <hi>a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout his Seat,</hi> may ſo point out <hi>the City of his Reſidence,</hi> that but one <hi>City in the World</hi> can anſwer the Deſcription; And that is <hi>the City which reigneth over the Kings of the Earth; and the City</hi> that ſo Reigned when <hi>John</hi> ſaw the Viſion, <hi>the City</hi> that hath ever ſince ſo Reigned, <hi>is Rome;</hi> the Angel I ſay, may thus tell <hi>John</hi> the Myſtery <hi>of the Woman,</hi> and <hi>of the Beaſt,</hi> but we muſt be ſure to let it be a <hi>Myſtery</hi> ſtill, and fix it <hi>any where</hi> but <hi>where it is.</hi> Oh the ſhame of the Cow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ardize of the Chriſtian! Oh the reproach of thoſe who have Eyes, and will not ſee!</p>
               <p>But are they willing, who ask the queſtion, to have it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved? What can be plainer than that 1260 Years is the date of <hi>Antichriſts Reign? This</hi> being <hi>the time</hi> that is allotted to the <hi>little Horn, Dan.</hi> 7. 25. This the time Set for the <hi>giving theoutward Court to the</hi> Gentiles, and <hi>the treading the Holy Cities</hi> under Foot. <hi>Rev.</hi> 11. 2. This</p>
               <p>Being <hi>the time</hi> for <hi>the two Witneſſes to Prophecy in Sack<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cloath,</hi> ver. 3. This</p>

               <p>Only when theſe 1260 Years were to begin ſeems the Diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty; but neither is that ſo obſcure, but we may eaſily point at it: I ſpeak not ſo as to point to the <hi>Day,</hi> or <hi>Year;</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe,</p>
               <p n="1">1. It may be we have no ſuch <hi>exact Chronology,</hi> that we can depend upon for ſuch <hi>expreſs, and minute Particulars:</hi> Or</p>
               <p n="2">2. Suppoſing the <hi>Maſters in this Art</hi> ſhould not fail, yet we muſt conſider that all great Tranſactions have <hi>a time</hi> to come to their <hi>Maturity,</hi> or <hi>End;</hi> and it will be hard for us to fix <hi>the very Critical Minute,</hi> where <hi>matters</hi> are to be accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhed <hi>by Degrees:</hi> As I do not think that the <hi>Fall of Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſt</hi> will be in a Moment; no, there is to be a <hi>Harveſt and Vintage,</hi> Rev. 14. 15. 18.

               <p>This being obſerved, I make no doubt, but that it will not be ſo obſcure, but we may point at it, and as our Lord ſaid, <hi>Mark</hi> 13. 30. may boldly pronounce (ſo near are we to the Completion of theſe Propheſies) <hi>this Generation ſhall not paſs, till all theſe things be done.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And firſt, as to the <hi>outward Court of the Temple being given to the</hi> Gentiles, <hi>and treading down the Holy Cities under Foot;</hi> when could that be, but when the <hi>Gentile,</hi> or <hi>Heathen-Worſhip</hi> firſt crept into the Church?

<pb n="147" facs="tcp:44425:97"/> aſcribes the <hi>Power, and Authority of St. Peter</hi> to his <hi>own Chair;</hi> and is angry, that in the Caſe of <hi>Eutyches,</hi> as is before there obſerved, they did not reſerve the matter to him, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore pretends he was not rightly Condemned; calls himſelf <hi>Eccleſiae Catholicae Epiſcopum Urbis Romae,</hi> the Biſhop of the Catholick Church of the City of <hi>Rome,</hi> with many other the like Exceſſes; which certainly may be one ſenſe of <hi>treading the Holy City</hi> under Foot, thus to exalt him above all others.</p>
               <p>And then for the tme of the <hi>two Witneſſes Propheſying in Sackcloth,</hi> where can we begin that better, than in the <hi>Teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony,</hi> which from that time, thoſe who were ſound in the Faith bore againſt theſe, and the like Exceſſes? Rather from the time <hi>that the two Teſtamennts, God's faithful Wisneſſes, the Holy Bible</hi> began in its Authority to be depreſt, and and the <hi>Fancies,</hi> and <hi>Inventions</hi> of Men to take place?

                  </gap>od that will fully accompliſh the <hi>Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling of the Jews,</hi> and <hi>fulneſs of the Gentiles;</hi> till the end of
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:44425:99"/> which, <hi>Daniel</hi> is told, that <hi>he ſhall rest,</hi> and <hi>ſtand in his Lot at the end of the Days.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Which <hi>end,</hi> if the <hi>Abomination that maketh deſolate,</hi> be the ſame with <hi>Idolatry</hi> brought into the Church, in that degree, which we have obſerved about the Year 455, will be about the Year 1715, to which adding for thoſe other two Periods mentioned by the Angel, <hi>i. e.</hi> what makes 1260, to be 1290, <hi>i. e.</hi> 30 Years; then we ſhall have for the Yeas there ſignified 1745, or what advances the ſaid 1260 to 1335, <hi>i. e.</hi> 75, the <hi>whole</hi> will be 1790; and as the <hi>Angel,</hi> ſo ſay I, <hi>Bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed is he that waiteth, and cometh to that time,</hi> for it will be a <hi>Bleſſed time</hi> for the Church of God, and <hi>the Glory of the Goſpel.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>One Remark more I have to add to this, before I leave it, that the ſeveral Periods we have been mentioning, for the ending the Reign of <hi>Antichriſt</hi> fall in likewiſe with what we read, <hi>Dan.</hi> 8. 14. 'Tis the Anſwer is there given to the Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion put by one Angel to another, asking, <hi>How long ſhall be the Viſion concerning the Daily Sacrifice, and the tranſgreſſion of Deſolation, to give both the Sanctuary, and the Hoſt to be trodden down;</hi> but returned to <hi>Daniel</hi> in theſe Words, <hi>And he ſaid un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to me, Unto two Thouſand, and three Hundred Days, then ſhall the Sanctuary be cleanſed.</hi> For conſider the time when this was ſaid to <hi>Daniel, viz.</hi> Before <hi>Chriſt</hi> 555; now, if we add to 555 before <hi>Chriſt,</hi> the number we juſt now aſſigned of 1745, theſe put together make up the forementioned 2300 years, the time there aſſigned; out of which again take 30, which is the number added to the ſo often mentioned 1260, and we have left 1715. Which in all likelihood, if we rightly compute, I mean if Chronology be herein exact, is the fixed time for the <hi>final Ruin of Antichriſt,</hi> or <hi>fall of Babylon;</hi> the great Enquiry we would ſo fain be ſatisfied in.</p>
               <p>But becauſe ſtill there will ariſe a difficulty upon either the <hi>different Computations</hi> that men uſe, or <hi>the Supernumerary days</hi> that are found in our <hi>ordinary years,</hi> beyond thoſe the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture ſeems to make uſe of; it may not be unuſeful to conſider how many years will be abated from this time, if we take out the odd days which there are in every year; which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing five, and <hi>ſome hours,</hi> if theſe be taken away from each year, (for ſo they muſt to make it juſt 360 days, which ſeems to
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:44425:99"/> be the Scripture-year) they make 17 <hi>years and a half,</hi> in the ſame proportion that 360 days make one year; which 17 years and a half, with the odd hours and minutes likewiſe, which are found in the ordinary year, taken out of the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid 1715, leaves it, as the laſt number to be enquired into, as a full anſwer to this great Queſtion, to be about the latter end of 1696.</p>
               <p>But in this 'twill be hard to require ſuch an exactneſs, as may not admit <hi>of a Latitude,</hi> eſpecially in a matter wherein <hi>Chriſt</hi> hath declared <hi>he will come as a Thief;</hi> wherein too the <hi>Holy Ghost</hi> himſelf hath ſpoken <hi>with that variety,</hi> as to lay down three ſeveral periods, <hi>viz.</hi> of 1260, 1290, and 1335, as we juſt now obſerv'd out of <hi>Daniel,</hi> and all in anſwer to the ſame queſtion; the reaſon whereof may be either becauſe 1. The <hi>Behaviour of men</hi> towards God, with reference to their preparing themſelves for the deliverance by their <hi>Repentance,</hi> is too often ſuch as defers the performance of his promiſes, which poſſibly might be the caſe here; not but that <hi>'tis ſtill certain</hi> in Gods Kalender, and ſuch is his <hi>Goodneſs,</hi> that the <hi>firſt, or ſhorteſt period</hi> is offered, and if the <hi>Viſion ſtay,</hi> 'tis the <hi>ſins of men</hi> that put the ſtop to it. Or,</p>
               <p>2. Becauſe ſuch <hi>great Affairs</hi> are not to be <hi>tranſacted</hi> in a <hi>point of time,</hi> and therefore for the <hi>commencing of them, the firſt period</hi> may be ſet, and that under <hi>the greatest certainty,</hi> i. e. the <hi>time, times and half a time,</hi> the 1260 <hi>days,</hi> the 42 <hi>months</hi> all concurring, as they do, to ſhew the <hi>certain downfal of Baby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lon</hi> at <hi>ſuch a time;</hi> As for the <hi>carrying on, and perfecting the great work,</hi> the <hi>other two</hi> may be aſſigned. Or elſe,</p>
               <p>3. Becauſe of the different <hi>Subjects</hi> concern'd herein, <hi>i. e.</hi> the <hi>ſuffering Chriſtians, or the Martyrs of Jeſus,</hi> in the time of the <hi>reign of Antichriſt,</hi> or the <hi>Jews and Gentiles</hi> in <hi>their fulneſs; both of whom</hi> were to be brought into <hi>the Church</hi> upon the <hi>Ruine of Antichriſt;</hi> but ſo, that deliverance muſt firſt come to the <hi>ſuffering Church</hi> then in being, before the <hi>effects of</hi> it could reach the <hi>others,</hi> who were to be the great Acceſſion to it.</p>
               <p>To <hi>the firſt,</hi> viz. the <hi>ſuffering Chriſtians, or Martyrs of Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus and their deliverance, the firſt period,</hi> viz. of 1260 years; to the <hi>other two,</hi> i. e. the <hi>Jews and Gentiles</hi> to be fully called
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:44425:100"/> in, the <hi>two other periods</hi> in all probability will belong; when 'tis promiſed <hi>Daniel,</hi> who receives the Anſwer there in the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>half <hi>of his people,</hi> i. e. <hi>the Jews,</hi> that he <hi>ſhall ſtand up in his Lot:</hi> A point (but that's beyond our Argument) that would well deſerve our Curioſity to be informed of; poſſibly what is here hinted, may ſtir up ſome excellent Perſon, to go on with ſo <hi>noble a deſign.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>For certainly, nothing can be ſo much for the honour of that <hi>Image, and likeneſs</hi> of God, in which man was made, as to be converſing with <hi>his Maker</hi> in the great <hi>Secrets and Myſteries</hi> of <hi>his Grace and Providence.</hi> I <hi>magnifie my Office,</hi> ſaith St. <hi>Paul,</hi> Rom. 11. 13. ſpeaking of that Adminiſtration that was given to him towards <hi>the Gentiles;</hi> he had too been ſpeaking in the context of the <hi>fulneſs of the Jews,</hi> and the certainty <hi>of their return:</hi> And if I may preſume at any thing of the Parallel, I know not any thing, wherein I ſhould ſo much <hi>magnifie my Office,</hi> as one of the meaneſt <hi>of the Miniſters and Servants of Chriſt,</hi> as in being in the loweſt degree inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental towards the unfolding any of <hi>thoſe myſterious Events,</hi> which are to happen in <hi>his Church,</hi> and will be ſo highly for <hi>his,</hi> and <hi>his Fathers glory:</hi> And I hope, indeed I queſtion it not, but he hath ſo far <hi>heard the deſire of the humble,</hi> and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted of <hi>the ſincerity of his poor Creature,</hi> as to have open'd <hi>his Eyes to ſee ſome of the wonderful things of his Law.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Such hath been the <hi>comfort,</hi> ſuch the <hi>joy</hi> that hath accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panied me in my loweſt ſtate, (for 'twas in a long fit of Sick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs I applied my ſelf to this work) that I dare not doubt, but it hath been from his <hi>good Spirit:</hi> And I am apt to think, through his <hi>Grace,</hi> without which we are able to do nothing, that what is here deliver'd by his ſo <hi>unworthy Servant,</hi> may be of that uſe to ſuch, who ſhall candidly, and diligently vouchſafe to peruſe it, that they will find ſome of that ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction <hi>in reading,</hi> which I have in <hi>writing it.</hi> Wherein if any thing be perform'd for the Service of <hi>Truth,</hi> I deſire wholly to aſcribe it to <hi>him,</hi> whoſe I am, the <hi>God of Truth,</hi> and to <hi>that aſſiſtance,</hi> he hath been pleaſed of his <hi>great Goodneſs,</hi> to vouchſafe to <hi>honeſt Endeavours:</hi> As all is due to <hi>him,</hi> ſo 'twas by Prayer <hi>to him</hi> his <hi>poor creature</hi> always endeavour'd to fetch in his ſuccour. The prayer with which he firſt ſet
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:44425:100"/> upon <hi>this work,</hi> and with which he reliev'd himſelf, when at a <hi>ſtand in it,</hi> is here ſubjoin'd with the ſame <hi>Preface,</hi> and in the <hi>ſame Form,</hi> in which he wrote it, when firſt ingaged in this ſort of Studies; which was ſeveral years ago; though his Thoughts were not drawn into this order, till occaſion'd to it, by <hi>Nubes Teſtium,</hi> and the <hi>reflections</hi> herein made on it.</p>

            <p>1260 Days or Years are aſſigned for the <hi>Reign of Antichrist,</hi> which beginning at 455 after Chriſt, the time upon ſo many ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counts fixed for it, as is at large there diſcourſed, gives us 1715; and the odd Days, Hours and Minutes in 1260 (for that is the number from whence the abatement muſt be made, it being only of that Period the Holy-Ghoſt ſo often ſpeaks under the different Meaſures) give us in the whole 18 years, and 125 days, 9 hours; <hi>i. e.</hi> five days to be taken from every year, will in in 1260 years give us 17 years and an half; and 5 hours taken like manner out of the ſaid 1260, will make 262 days, 12 hours; and then for the 49 minutes to be alſo thus taken out, thoſe in 1260 years, amount to 42 days, and 21 hours: For 49 minutes multiplied by 1260, give for the whole number of Minutes 61740; which divided by 60 for hours, give 1029 hours, and that again by 24 for days, gives 42 days, 21 hours. Now out of 1715, take 18 years and 125 days and 9 hours, and that will throw it back to the latter end of 1696, <hi>i. e.</hi> 125 days and 9 hours in that year, which generally ſpeaking, I ſay to be about the later end of that year.</p>
            <p>Not that for the Reaſons there mentioned, and thoſe <hi>p.</hi> 146. I would preſume ſo to fix this in a Point, as not to allow a great Latitude for the completion of ſuch Predictions; which number is to be taken, the event muſt ſhew, and when that comes, that will regulate all our Chronology; but that it lies within the compaſs of the numbers there offered, I cannot have the leaſt Scruple. God Almighty clear up the Minds, and Eyes of Men to wait for, behold, and adore his wonderful Works; for I cannot but add it again, <hi>BEHOLD I COME AS A THIEF.</hi>

            <p>THIS Book is dated in the Year 1120, and the Title that is prefixed to the <hi>Treatiſe of Antichriſt,</hi> is this.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>As the Smoak goes before the Fire,</hi> as <hi>the Battle before the Victory,</hi> ſo <hi>the Temptation of Antichrist goes before Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry:</hi> and then the Book it ſelf follows thus.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">Who Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſt is.</note> Antichriſt is the falſhood of Eternal Damnation, covered with the appearance of Truth, and of the Righteouſneſs of Chriſt and his Spouſe: Oppoſed in like manner to the way of Truth, of Juſtice, of Faith, of Hope, of Charity, and to a moral Life, and the miniſterial truth of the Church; 'tis me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naged by falſe Apoſtles, and moſt obſtinately maintained on all hands. Or elſe <hi>Antichriſt</hi> is a <hi>Cheat,</hi> which hides the Truth of Salvation both in Subſtantial and Miniſterial Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters; or elſe is a fraudulent oppoſing of Chriſt, and his Spouſe, and every faithful Member. And ſo it is not any particular Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, ſet in any Degree, Office, or Miniſtry, <hi>i. e.</hi> commonly ſo conſidered; but it is the ſame falſhood oppoſed to Truth, which is covered with, and makes ſhew of Beauty; and Pie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, out of the Church of Chriſt, as in certain Names, Offices, Scriptures, Sacraments, and in many other things; which ſort of <hi>Iniquity,</hi> with its Miniſters, great and ſmall, and all thoſe who with a wicked and blind Heart follow them; <note place="margin">His names.</note> ſuch a Congregation taken together, is called <hi>Antichriſt,</hi> or <hi>Babylon,</hi> or the <hi>fourth Beaſt,</hi> or <hi>Where,</hi> or the <hi>Man of Sin,</hi> and <hi>Son of Perdition.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>His Miniſters are called <hi>Falſe Prophets, Lyars, Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters of Darkneſs, the Spirit of Error, the Where in the Revelation, the Mother of Fornication, Clouds without Water, Autumnal Trees dead, and twice pulled up by the Root, Waters of the cruel Sea, Wandring Stars, Balaamites, and Egyptians.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">Why called Antichriſt.</note> He is called <hi>Antichrist,</hi> becauſe being covered and decked with the Livery of Chriſt, and of his Church, and of his faithful Members, he acts contrary to the Salvation wrought
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:44425:103"/> by Chriſt, and truly adminiſtred in the Church of Chriſt; which as the Faithful partake of by Faith, Hope, and Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, ſo he oppoſes it by worldly Wiſdom, by falſe Religion, by feigned Goodneſs, by Spiritual Power, by ſecular Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranny, by Riches, Honours, and Dignities, by Luxury, and the Delights of the World.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">How mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſted.</note> So that it is manifeſt to every one, that <hi>Antichriſt</hi> cannot come but where all thoſe things above-mentioned meet to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether to make up perfect Hypocriſie, and falſhood, that is to ſay, the wiſe Men of this World, the <hi>Religious,</hi> the Phari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſees, Miniſters, Doctors, the ſecular Power, with the People of the World all joined together; ſo that all together have made up a perfect <hi>Man of Sin, and Error.</hi> For although <hi>Antichriſt</hi> was already conceived in the times of the Apoſtles, yet becauſe he was ſtill as 'twere in his Infancy; he wanted both inward and outward Members; and foraſmuch as they knew him, they more eaſily ruined him, and turned him out of their Communion, as being but yet rude and unformed, and ſilenced him: For as yet he had not the Wiſdom nor Reaſon to excuſe himſelf, to define and pronounce Sentence: He had not yet his lying Miniſters, and humane Traditions were wanting, and Religious Orders were not yet abroad. And therefore however he was fallen into Error, and Sin, yet he had not wherewith to cover Filthineſs and Shame of his Errors and Sin; having neither Riches, nor Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferments, he could not draw to him any Miniſter for his Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, had no way to encreaſe, preſerve, or defend thoſe that belonged to him. For he was deſtitute of Power, or ſecular Strength, and he could not force or compel any from the Truth to Falſhood. And becauſe many things were thus wanting, he could not corrupt nor ſcandalize any by his Cheats, and ſo being as yet tender and feeble, he could not gain place in the Church. But growing up in his Members, <hi>i. e.</hi> in his blind Miniſters, and Hypocrites, and Subjects of the World, he is grown to be a perfect Man, at full Age, <hi>i. e.</hi> ſince the Lovers of thee World, both ſpiritual and temporal Perſons, blind in the Faith are multiplied in the Church with all Power. They being wicked, deſiring to be ſought to, and honoured in Spiritual things, and to cover their Grandeur,
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:44425:104"/> Malice, and Sins, made uſe of the Wiſe of this World, and Phariſees to this Purpoſe, as hath been above ſaid. Now this is a great wickedneſs to diſguiſe, and ſet off Wickedneſs that deſerves Excommunication, and by that means to make themſelves what is to be allowed to no Man, but belongs only to God, and Jeſus Chriſt the Mediator; <note place="margin">That he robs Chriſt of the Honour due to him.</note> to take away theſe things from God fraudulently, and by Rapine, and transfer them to himſelf, and his Works, ſeems to be the greateſt Robbery: Such are the aſſuming to himſelf the Power of regenerating, <note place="margin">He pardons Sins.</note> of pardoning Sins, of giving the Graces of the Holy Spirit, of making Chriſt, and ſuch like things; and in all theſe things to cover himſelf with the Cloak of Authority, and of the Word; By this means deceiving the ignorant People, who follow the World in theſe things, and are of the World, and departing from God, and from the true Faith and Reformati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the holy Spirit, departing from true Repentance and Perſeverance in what is good, departing from Charity, Patience, Poverty, Humility; and that which is worſe then all, departing from true hope, to relye upon all that is ill, and the vain hope of the World, enſlaving themſelves to all the Ceremonies that belong to ſuch things, <note place="margin">He makes Men to wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

               <hi>What the Works of</hi> Antichriſt <hi>are?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">The firſt work of Antichriſt is to baniſh truth out of the World.</note> The firſt work of <hi>Antichrist</hi> is to take away Truth, and to change it into Falſhood, Error, and Hereſie; the ſecond work of <hi>Antichriſt</hi> is to cover Falſhood with Truth, and to confirm and prove a Lye by the Faith, and by Vertues, and to mix Falſhood with ſpiritual things for the People under him, whether by the means of his Miniſters, or by the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtry, or whatever elſe there is in the Church. Now theſe two ways of proceeding contain a perfect and accompliſhed Malice, ſuch as no Tyrant, no Potentate from the beginning of the World to the <hi>time of Antichriſt,</hi> could ever yet ſhew. And there never yet was any Enemy who could ſo turn the way of Truth into falſhood, or falſhood into Truth; or that in like manner hath perverted thoſe, who make Profeſſion of one, or the other, <hi>i. e.</hi> either of Truth or Falſhood. So that the Holy Mother the Church, with her true Children, are altogether trodden under Foot, eſpecially as to Truth, and for the ſake of the true Worſhip according to truth, and as to the Miniſtry, and the right uſe thereof, and her Children, who partake of the ſame. She weeps bitterly in ſpeaking of it, and in the Complaint of <hi>Jeremiah,</hi> ſhe ſaith, <hi>How doth the City ſit ſolitary, that was full of People,</hi> as Heathen, and uncircum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſed? <hi>She is become a Widow,</hi> that is to ſay deſtitute of the Truth of her Spouſe, ſhe that was <hi>the Miſtreſs of Nations,</hi> by reaſon of her ſubjections to Errors, and Sin; <hi>the Princeſs among the Provinces,</hi> by ſeeking her Portion in the World, and the things which are of the World. Weep, and look forward, and thou ſhalt find that now all theſe things are accompliſhed at this time. For the <hi>Holy Church</hi> is reputed a <hi>Synagogue,</hi> and the <hi>Synagogue</hi> of the Wicked is declared to be the Mother of thoſe who beſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve the Law: Falſhood is Preached for Truth, Injuſtice is Preached for Juſtice, Error for the Faith, Sin for Vertue, a Lye for the Truth.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>What the Works are that proceed from the former?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Theſe they are: The firſt Work is that which turns the Service of <hi>Latria,</hi> which is not properly due but to the <hi>on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly one God,</hi> to him [Antichriſt] and his Works; to a poor Creature, reaſonable or unreaſonable, ſenſible or unſenſible; Reaſonable, as to Man, to Saints of both Sexes gone out of
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:44425:105"/> this World, and to Images to a ſtinking Carcaſs, or Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licks. His Works are the Sacraments, eſpecially the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Euchariſt, which he adores as God, and as Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt, worſhips things Bleſſed and Conſecrated, and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bids to worſhip God alone.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">The 2d is to rob Jeſus Chriſt of his Merit.</note> The ſecond work of <hi>Antichriſt</hi> is, that he takes away, and robs Chriſt of his Merit, with all the ſufficiency of Grace, of Juſtice, of Regeneration, of Remiſſion of Sins, of Sanctifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, of Confirmation, of ſpiritual Nouriſhment, and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putes and attributes all to his own Authority, and a form of words, to his Works, and Saints, and their Interceſſion, and to the Fire of Purgatory, and draws away the People to theſe things here mentioned, that they might neither ſeek the things of Chriſt, nor by Chriſt, but only by the works of their own Hands, and not by a lively Faith either in God, or in Chriſt, or in the Holy Spirit, but by the Will and Works of <hi>Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſt,</hi> ſo that he Preaches that all Salvation conſiſts in his VVorks.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">The 3d is a dead Faith.</note> The third work of <hi>Antichriſt</hi> conſiſts in this, that he attributes the Reformation of the holy Spirit, to a dead, outward Faith, and Baptizeth Infants in this Faith, teaching that by <hi>that,</hi> it is they muſt Baptiſm and Regeneration, and in that he makes Prieſts, and gives Orders, and the other Sacraments, and founds all Chriſtianity in it, which is indeed contrary to the Holy Spirit.</p>

            <p>
               <note place="margin">The 5th is Simony.</note> The fifth Work of <hi>Antichriſt</hi> is this, That he doth all his Works to be ſeen, that ſo he may gratifie his inſatiable Ava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rice, by putting all things to Sale and doing nothing without Simony.</p>

               <note place="margin">The 6th is Conniving at Vices.</note> The ſixth Work of <hi>Antichriſt</hi> is, That he gives Licenſe to

               <note place="margin">The 7th the Uſurpation of Temporal Authority.</note> The ſeventh Work of <hi>Antichriſt</hi> is, That he governs not, nor defends his Unity by the Holy Spirit, but by Secular Power, and that he takes to his Aid Spiritual things.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">The 8th the Perſecution of the Faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful.</note> The eighth Work of <hi>Antichriſt</hi> is, That he hates, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecutes, and purſues, pillages, and murders the Members of Chriſt; theſe are the Principal of his Works, which he doth againſt the Truth, all of which can in no manner be numbred, or written; but it ſufficeth for the preſent, to have markt out, what is moſt general, by which this <hi>Iniquity</hi> is cover'd.</p>

            <p>
               <note place="margin">4.

            </p>
            <p>In the fifth place, by outward Holineſs, by Prayers, by Faſts, by Vigils, and Alms; againſt which the Apoſtle ſpeaks <hi>having the Form of Godlineſs,</hi> but denying the Power thereof.</p>
            <p>In the ſixth place, he covers his Iniquity by certain Words of Chriſt, by the Writings of the Ancients, and by the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cils, which they obſerve ſo far, as they deſtroy not their <hi>wicked life</hi> and pleaſure.</p>
            <p>In the ſeventh place, by the Adminiſtration of the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, by which they belch out the chief of their Errors.</p>
            <p>In the eighth place, by Reproving, and Preaching in their

            <p>In the ninth place, by the Vertuous life of certain, who live in diſſimulation, and of others, who do it in earneſt. For the Elect of God, who love, and practice what is good, are detained there, as in <hi>Babylon,</hi> and are, as 'twere Gold, with which the wicked Antichriſt covers his Vanity, not ſuffering them to Worſhip God alone, nor that they ſhould place their hope on Chriſt alone, nor that they ſhould underſtand the true Religion.</p>
            <p>Theſe, and many other ſuch things, are as 'twere the Cloak, and Garments of <hi>Antichriſt,</hi> with which he covers his lying malice, that ſo he may not be rejected as a Heathen, and under which he walks ſhameleſsly, and as a <hi>Whore.</hi>
